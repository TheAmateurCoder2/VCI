It specializes in seed stage , early stage, and growth stage investments in private companies across technology sectors. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] As of January 2025, the firm had approximately US$56 billion in assets under management (AUM). [ 5 ] The firm operates three regionally-focused venture entities, as Sequoia in Europe, Peak XV Partners in Southeast Asia, and HongShan in China. [ 6 ] Sequoia has made a wide variety of venture investments since inception, including in Apple , ByteDance , and Cisco , among many others. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] History [ edit ] The firm was named after the Sequoia tree , indigenous to California. Sequoia was founded by Don Valentine in 1972 in Menlo Park, California, [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] at a time when the state's venture capital industry was just beginning to develop. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Sequoia formed its first venture capital fund in 1974, [ 12 ] [ 14 ] and was an early investor in Atari the next year. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 1978, Sequoia became one of the first investors in Apple . [ 16 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Partners Doug Leone and Michael Moritz assumed leadership of the firm in 1996. [ 15 ] [ 20 ] In 1999, Sequoia established a dedicated investment fund for Israeli startups. [ 21 ] [ 12 ] In 2005, Sequoia Capital China was established, [ 22 ] later followed by Sequoia Capital India. [ 23 ] In 2012, Moritz took a step back from the day-to-day operations of the firm. [ 24 ] Leone became Global Managing Partner. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Jim Goetz led Sequoia's U.S. business from 2012 until 2017, when he was succeeded by Roelof Botha . [ 27 ] In 2016, Sequoia hired Jess Lee , making her the first female investing partner in the United States in the firm's history. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In 2019, it was the most active VC fund company in India. [ 30 ] In March 2020, Sequoia announced it would hire Luciana Lixandru as its first partner based in Europe. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In October 2021, Sequoia announced it would implement a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business that would allow it to remain involved with companies after their public market debuts. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] In March 2022, The Information reported that Sequoia Capital China was raising an $8 billion fund to invest in Chinese tech companies. [ 36 ] Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had backstopped Sequoia's $1 billion in deposits in the bank. [ 37 ] In June 2023, Sequoia announced plans to break up into three entities citing complications running a decentralized global investment business in the middle of geopolitical tensions. [ 38 ] Following the separation, expected to complete by March 2024, the Chinese business led by Neil Shen would be called HongShan (\"sequoia\" in Mandarin) and the Indian and Southeast Asia arm would be named Peak XV Partners. The U.S. and Europe unit would retain the Sequoia name. [ 39 ] In July 2023, Sequoia announced to cut one-third of its talent staff as part of an organizational restructuring. [ 40 ] In October 2023, the U.S. House Committee on U.S.–China Competition announced a probe into Sequoia Capital's investments in China. [ 41 ] As of at least 2024, Sequoia is the largest investor in China's consumer internet sector . [ 42 ] : 94 It has often used a strategy of investing in several competitors in the same sector and then later pushing for their consolidation. [ 42 ] : 94–95 According to Chinese media , Sequoia was one of the major influences in mergers between Meituan and Dianping , between Uber China and Didi , and between VShop and Lefenghui. [ 42 ] : 95 In July 2025, Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire stated that Zohran Mamdani , a Muslim American New York City mayoral candidate, \"came from a culture that lies about everything\" and seeks to advance \"his Islamist agenda\". [ 43 ] [ 44 ] That statement was widely denounced as bigoted and Islamophobic. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] In response, 600 founders of tech startups signed an open letter to Sequoia, asking Sequoia to adopt \"a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech and religious bigotry .\" [ 43 ] In August 2025, Sequoia's COO, Sumaiya Balbale, who is open about the influence of her Muslim faith on her career, resigned after five years with the company over Maguire's posts after other senior partners decline to take action against Maguire on the basis of free speech. [ 47 ] In November 2025, Botha was succeeded by Alfred Lin and Pat Grady as joint managing partners of the firm. [ 48 ] The pair became known as \"stewards,\" in line with the firm's stewardship model created by Don Valentine. [ 49 ] Investments [ edit ] Investors, referred to as limited partners, contribute money to a fund that the firm's general partners then invest in business ventures. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Its limited partners have primarily been university endowments, charitable foundations, and other large institutions. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Sequoia specializes in seed stage, [ 55 ] early stage, [ 55 ] and growth stage [ 56 ] investments in private technology companies, [ 57 ] including those in the clean tech, consumer internet, crypto, financial services, healthcare, mobile, and robotics sectors. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] The firm has been often recognized for its strong track record of early investments. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The firm has also distinguished itself from other top venture capital firms by diversifying its investments and not just focusing on U.S. early-stage venture capital. [ 56 ] [ 12 ] [ 63 ] Sequoia is an umbrella brand for three different venture entities: one focused on the U.S. and Europe, another on India and Southeast Asia, and a third on China. [ 64 ] Following the June 2023 announcement to make the three entities independent, from 2024 the ventures would no longer share investors or profits. [ 65 ] [ 38 ] A notable opportunity missed by Sequoia was the failure to invest in Facebook in its early days c. 2005; John Naughton suggested that this failure led to \" fear of missing out \" and may have contributed to Sequoia's investing heavily in FTX in 2022, prior to its collapse in 2023. [ 66 ] In 2019, Hurun Research Institute identified Sequoia as the world's top unicorn investor, noting it had invested in one in five of all private companies valued at $1 billion or more. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] In July 2021, Sequoia published a piece about \"the Latin American startup opportunity\" that signaled it would increase its focus there. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] In October 2021, Sequoia announced the Sequoia Capital Fund, a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business. [ 71 ] The fund structure is unique for VC funds as they are typically funds with a 10-year fund cycle instead of an open-ended evergreen fund. [ 72 ] The Sequoia fund will no longer need to sell or distribute stock as in the usual VC fund cycle. Instead, limited partners who want liquidity can pull money out of the fund. [ 73 ] Sequoia also announced it would become a RIA which would allow the firm more flexibility in its investments. [ 72 ] In February 2022, Sequoia raised a $600 million Sequoia Crypto Fund. As one of the first sub-funds of Sequoia Capital Fund, the crypto fund will mainly invest in cryptocurrencies traded on third-party exchanges. [ 74 ] In June 2022, Sequoia announced that it had raised $2.85 billion in additional funds to invest in India and Southeast Asia. [ 75 ] The amount of funds raised is also the largest to date for the company in both India and Southeast Asia. [ 76 ] In early 2023, the size of Sequoia Capital Fund reached $13.6 billion. [ 77 ] In June 2023, the firm led a Seed round funding of $5.7 million for Defense startup, Mach Industries. [ 78 ] Sequoia Capital along with other notable venture capital investors made an investment in the cryptocurrency exchange FTX , founded by Sam Bankman-Fried . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Sequoia was very enthusiastic about FTX, and published an article which was a glowing tribute to Bankman-Fried [ 83 ] on its website on 22 September 2022. [ 66 ] [ 84 ] FTX failed in 2023, with about $8 billion of investors' money missing, and Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud. The value of Sequoia's investment in FTX was ultimately written down to $0; it is estimated that they lost $214 million on their investment. [ 85 ] The company released a notice to investors, stating that their stake in FTX represented a small amount of their investment portfolio. [ 86 ] They also removed the profile of Bankman-Fried from their website. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] In July 2023, it reduced the size of its cryptocurrency fund from $585 million to $200 million, and shifted focus to young start-ups after an industry crash. [ 90 ] In 2023, Sequoia launched its Open Source Fellowship to fund up to three open source developers annually via an equity-free fellowship. [ 91 ] In March 2025, Bloomberg announced, Sequoia's leading $190 million investment round for a law enforcement technology startup Peregrine. [ 92 ] That same month, Kela, an Israeli defense-tech startup founded by former intelligence officers during the Gaza invasion that was co-funded by Sequoia, was launched. [ 93 ] In May 2025, Sequoia invested £100 million in Mubi , valuing the company at $1 billion. [ 94 ] The investment sparked controversy due to Sequoia's previous funding of Kela.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Sequoia Scouts have invested in over 1,000 companies. [ 118 ] Sequoia was the first venture capital firm to offer a scout program, and the model has since been emulated by others in the industry. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Sequoia expanded the scout program into Europe in 2019, backing a network of operators, founders, and early-stage investors across the region. [ 119 ] The launch was led by partners Luciana Lixandru and Matt Miller, who helped recruit the first cohort of European scouts. [ 120 ] In 2021, Sequoia partnered on the BLCK VC Scout Network to provide training and education to current and aspiring Black scouts. [ 118 ] In March 2022, Sequoia launched Arc, a structured program in which participants receive $1 million in funding to work with Sequoia partners in both London and Silicon Valley.

The company has offices in Palo Alto, California and San Francisco, California , with additional offices in London , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and India. [ 3 ] The company's most notable investment was a $12.7 million investment in Facebook in May 2005 for 10% of the company, before the company had revenue. Accel invests in enterprise, SaaS , and consumer companies in seed, early, and growth-stage worldwide. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] In 1983, Accel was founded by Arthur Patterson and Jim Swartz. [ 5 ] The co-founders developed the firm's \"prepared mind\" investment philosophy based on the Louis Pasteur quote \"chance favors the prepared mind\", [ 6 ] which they say requires \"deep focus\" and a disciplined and informed approach to investing. [ 7 ] In 2000, Accel and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts formed Accel-KKR, an independently operated technology-focused private equity investment firm focused on control investments in middle-market companies. [ 8 ] In the same year, Accel partnered with IDG Capital to create IDG-Accel, a joint venture focusing on early-stage and growth investments in the Chinese market. [ 9 ] In May 2005, Accel, under the leadership of Jim Breyer, invested $12.7 million for 10% of Facebook , before the company had revenue. [ 10 ] This investment became one of the most lucrative in venture capital history and was worth $6.6 billion at the time of the company's initial public offering in 2012. [ 11 ] Investments and fundraises [ edit ] In December 2019, the company raised $550 million in its 6th investment fund focused on India. [ 12 ] In May 2024, Accel raised a $650 million fund to invest in early-stage companies across Europe and Israel, with a focus on artificial intelligence and computer security . Fundraising was facilitated, in part, by the establishment of Accel's London office in 2000. [ 13 ] In January 2025, Accel raised a $650 million early stage fund for startups in India and South East Asia. This was the firm's 8th fund focused on India.

    "text": "Sequoia Capitalis an Americanventure capitalfirm headquartered inMenlo Park, California. It specializes inseed stage, early stage, and growth stage investments in private companies across technology sectors.As of January 2025, the firm had approximately US$56 billion inassets under management(AUM). The firm operates three regionally-focused venture entities, as Sequoia in Europe, Peak XV Partners in Southeast Asia, andHongShanin China.Sequoia has made a wide variety of venture investments since inception, including inApple,ByteDance, andCisco, among many others. Sequoia was founded byDon Valentinein 1972 in Menlo Park, California,at a time when the state's venture capital industry was just beginning to develop.Sequoia formed its first venture capital fund in 1974,and was an early investor inAtarithe next year.In 1978, Sequoia became one of the first investors inApple.PartnersDoug LeoneandMichael Moritzassumed leadership of the firm in 1996. In 1999, Sequoia established a dedicated investment fund for Israeli startups.In 2005, Sequoia Capital China was established,later followed by Sequoia Capital India.In 2012, Moritz took a step back from the day-to-day operations of the firm.Leone became Global Managing Partner.Jim Goetzled Sequoia's U.S. business from 2012 until 2017, when he was succeeded byRoelof Botha.In 2016, Sequoia hiredJess Lee, making her the first female investing partner in the United States in the firm's history.In 2019, it was the most activeVC fundcompany in India. In March 2020, Sequoia announced it would hire Luciana Lixandru as its first partner based in Europe.In October 2021, Sequoia announced it would implement a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business that would allow it to remain involved with companies after their public market debuts.In March 2022,The Informationreported that Sequoia Capital China was raising an $8 billion fund to invest in Chinese tech companies.Following thecollapse of Silicon Valley Bankin March 2023, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporationhad backstopped Sequoia's $1billion in deposits in the bank. In June 2023, Sequoia announced plans to break up into three entities citing complications running a decentralized global investment business in the middle of geopolitical tensions.Following the separation, expected to complete by March 2024, the Chinese business led byNeil Shenwould be calledHongShan(\"sequoia\" in Mandarin) and the Indian and Southeast Asia arm would be named Peak XV Partners. The U.S. and Europe unit would retain the Sequoia name.In July 2023, Sequoia announced to cut one-third of its talent staff as part of an organizational restructuring.In October 2023, theU.S. House Committee on U.S.–China Competitionannounced a probe into Sequoia Capital's investments in China. As of at least 2024, Sequoia is the largest investor inChina's consumer internet sector.It has often used a strategy of investing in several competitors in the same sector and then later pushing for their consolidation.According toChinese media, Sequoia was one of the major influences in mergers betweenMeituanandDianping, betweenUber ChinaandDidi, and between VShop and Lefenghui. In July 2025, Sequoia partnerShaun Maguirestated thatZohran Mamdani, aMuslim AmericanNew York Citymayoralcandidate, \"came from a culture that lies about everything\" and seeks to advance \"hisIslamistagenda\".That statement was widely denounced as bigoted and Islamophobic.In response, 600 founders of tech startups signed an open letter to Sequoia, asking Sequoia to adopt \"azero-tolerance policyonhate speechandreligious bigotry.\"In August 2025, Sequoia's COO, Sumaiya Balbale, who is open about the influence of her Muslim faith on her career, resigned after five years with the company over Maguire's posts after other senior partners decline to take action against Maguire on the basis of free speech. In November 2025, Botha was succeeded byAlfred Linand Pat Grady as joint managing partners of the firm.The pair became known as \"stewards,\" in line with the firm's stewardship model created by Don Valentine. Investors, referred to as limited partners, contribute money to a fund that the firm's general partners then invest in business ventures.Its limited partners have primarily been university endowments, charitable foundations, and other large institutions.Sequoia specializes in seed stage,early stage,and growth stageinvestments in private technology companies,including those in the clean tech, consumer internet, crypto, financial services, healthcare, mobile, and robotics sectors.The firm has been often recognized for its strong track record of early investments.The firm has also distinguished itself from other top venture capital firms by diversifying its investments and not just focusing on U.S. early-stage venture capital.Sequoia is an umbrella brand for three different venture entities: one focused on the U.S. and Europe, another on India and Southeast Asia, and a third on China.Following the June 2023 announcement to make the three entities independent, from 2024 the ventures would no longer share investors or profits. A notable opportunity missed by Sequoia was the failure to invest inFacebookin its early days c. 2005;John Naughtonsuggested that this failure led to \"fear of missing out\" and may have contributed to Sequoia's investing heavily in FTX in 2022, prior to its collapse in 2023.In 2019,Hurun Research Instituteidentified Sequoia as the world's topunicorninvestor, noting it had invested in one in five of all private companies valued at $1 billion or more.In July 2021, Sequoia published a piece about \"the Latin American startup opportunity\" that signaled it would increase its focus there. In October 2021, Sequoia announced the Sequoia Capital Fund, a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business.The fund structure is unique for VC funds as they are typically funds with a 10-year fund cycle instead of an open-ended evergreen fund.The Sequoia fund will no longer need to sell or distribute stock as in the usual VC fund cycle. Instead, limited partners who want liquidity can pull money out of the fund.Sequoia also announced it would become aRIAwhich would allow the firm more flexibility in its investments.In February 2022, Sequoia raised a $600 million Sequoia Crypto Fund. As one of the first sub-funds of Sequoia Capital Fund, the crypto fund will mainly invest in cryptocurrencies traded on third-party exchanges. In June 2022, Sequoia announced that it had raised $2.85 billion in additional funds to invest in India and Southeast Asia.The amount of funds raised is also the largest to date for the company in both India and Southeast Asia.In early 2023, the size of Sequoia Capital Fund reached $13.6 billion. In June 2023, the firm led a Seed round funding of $5.7 million for Defense startup, Mach Industries.Sequoia Capital along with other notable venture capital investors made an investment in thecryptocurrency exchangeFTX, founded bySam Bankman-Fried.Sequoia was very enthusiastic about FTX, and published an article which was a glowing tribute to Bankman-Friedon its website on 22 September 2022.FTX failed in 2023, with about $8 billion of investors' money missing, and Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud. The value of Sequoia's investment in FTX was ultimately written down to $0; it is estimated that they lost $214 million on their investment.The company released a notice to investors, stating that their stake in FTX represented a small amount of their investment portfolio.They also removed the profile of Bankman-Fried from their website. In July 2023, it reduced the size of its cryptocurrency fund from $585 million to $200 million, and shifted focus to young start-ups after an industry crash.In 2023, Sequoia launched its Open Source Fellowship to fund up to three open source developers annually via an equity-free fellowship. In March 2025, Bloomberg announced, Sequoia's leading $190 million investment round for a law enforcement technology startup Peregrine.That same month, Kela, an Israeli defense-tech startup founded by former intelligence officers during theGaza invasionthat was co-funded by Sequoia, was launched.In May 2025, Sequoia invested £100 million inMubi, valuing the company at $1 billion.The investment sparked controversy due to Sequoia's previous funding of Kela. In 2009, Sequoia launched its scout program, which functions as an individual investor network that provides founders and other individuals with capital to invest in promising early-stage startups.Sequoia Scouts have invested in over 1,000 companies.Sequoia was the first venture capital firm to offer a scout program, and the model has since been emulated by others in the industry. Sequoia expanded the scout program into Europe in 2019, backing a network of operators, founders, and early-stage investors across the region.The launch was led by partners Luciana Lixandru and Matt Miller, who helped recruit the first cohort of European scouts. In 2021, Sequoia partnered on the BLCK VC Scout Network to provide training and education to current and aspiring Black scouts.In March 2022, Sequoia launched Arc, a structured program in which participants receive $1 million in funding to work with Sequoia partners in both London and Silicon Valley.",

Between 2006 and 2010, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz actively invested intechnology companies. Both separately and together, they invested $4 million in 45 startups, includingTwitter.During this time, the two became known as \"super angel\" investors. On July 6, 2009, Andreessen and Horowitz launched their venture capital fund with an initial capitalization of $300 million.In November 2010, at a time when the field ofventure capitalismwas contracting, the company raised an additional $650 million for a second venture fund.In less than two years, the firm was managing a total of $1.2 billion under the two funds. As of March 27, 2014, the firm was managing $4 billion in assets following the closing of its fourth fund at $1.5 billion. In addition to Andreessen and Horowitz, the firm's general partners includeJohn O'Farrell,Scott Weiss,Jeff Jordan,Peter Levine,Chris Dixon,Vijay Pande,Martin Casado, and Andrew Chen.Ex-VMwareCEO Raghu Raghuram joined the firm as general partner in October 2025.Margit Wennmachersserved as operating partner from 2010 to July 2025, when she became partner emeritus. In March 2019, it was reported that Andreessen Horowitz was opening an office inSan Francisco. In January 2022, Andreessen Horowitz raised $9 billion for its venture capital, growth-stage, and biotech-focused funds. As of May 2024, the firm is managing $42 billion in assets. By 2012,Business Insiderwrote that, \"Andreessen Horowitz is the most powerful and respected venture capital firm in Silicon Valley right now.\"The firm is often cited as the largest and one of the most powerful venture capital funds in the world.Marc Andreessen in particular is often cited as one of the most powerful venture capitalists, who is dominant, if also controversial, not only in Silicon Valley, but also in politics. As per the websiteOfficeChai's calculations (up to October 2025), since 2020, Andreessen Horowitz has backed 32unicorns, more than any other venture firm.By November 2025, Andreessen Horowitz's website lists 1076 portfolio companies.The note reads: \"Any investments or portfolio companies mentioned, referred to, or described on this page are not representative of all investments in vehicles managed by a16z and there can be no assurance that the investments will be profitable or that other investments made in the future will have similar characteristics or results. Exits include current and former a16z portfolio companies which have been acquired as well as companies which have undergone an initial public offering or direct public offering of shares. Certain publicly traded companies on this list may still be held in Andreessen Horowitz funds.\"The American Dynamism section lists 50 companies. Leslie Feinzaigwrites onFast Companythat nowadays Andreessen Horowitz and other big firms do not act like traditional venture capital firms anymore, but invest beyond early-stage private companies, including public equities, crypto tokens, non-traditional assets, and more. There is also a tendency towards competing for the obvious alpha, and not just making the contrarian's bet. In 2023, the firm launched a $600 million American Dynamism fund \"with the broad aim of supporting companies building in the nation’s interest\".The fund focuses on hard tech sectors which serve national interest, including space, defense, manufacturing, robotics. The fund has backed companies like the defense manufacturing startup Hadrian and the hypersonic long-range rocket startup Castelion.

The summit is officially non-partisan and has partnered with Democratic defense officials like former Deputy Secretary of DefenseKathleen Hicks. The fund is managed by three general partners, namelyKatherine Boyle,David Ulevitchand Erin Price-Wright. Boyle plays an important role in the initiative. She declares in her essay In an essay titled \"Building American Dynamism\" that, \"I believe the only way to reverse the course of stagnation and kick-start nationwide renewal post-Covid is through technologists building companies that support the national interest.\" She has previous interned atFounders Fundand is influenced by Peter Thiel's thinking. In 2016, she joinedGeneral Catalystwhere she helped fundAnduril, before joining Andreessen Horowitz. Her portfolio at Andreessen Horowitz includesHadrian(manufacturing in aerospace and defense), Apex Space (satellites) and Castelion (hypersonic weapons). In 2009, Andreessen Horowitz made its first two investments: one in business management SaaS developerApptioand one inSkypestock. According to Horowitz, the Skype investment was seen as risky by other experts in the field, who believed the company would be crippled by ongoing intellectual property litigation and direct competitive attacks fromGoogleandApple.The firm's founders viewed the investment as a success following Skype's sale toMicrosoftin May 2011 for $8.5 billion.

    "text": " Benchmark Capital Advisors LLC(commonly known asBenchmark) is an Americanventure capitalfirm founded in 1995 byBob Kagle,Bruce Dunlevie,Andy Rachleff,Kevin Harvey,and Val Vaden.The firm is known for its equal partnership structureand focus on early-stage investing, typically leading the first institutional round of funding while taking a board seat with each company it invests in. Benchmark was founded in 1995by five partners:Bob Kagle,Bruce Dunlevie,Andy Rachleff,Kevin Harvey,and Val Vaden.The firm is noted for creating the first equal ownership and compensation structure for its partners,where there are no \"junior partners\" or \"senior partners,\" and there are also noCEO-like position held,differing from other VC firms which are named for their founders and are structured hierarchically.The firm has stated the reason for maintaining this approach is to \"force discipline and accountability to focus on what matters\" for its founders and limited partners,as their profits are driven by investment performance as opposed to management fees.The collective decision-making structure also means that Benchmark shares responsibility for the performance of the companies the firm invests in, not just the single partner who joins the company's board of directors. Prior partners with the firm includeBill Gurley(who stepped back from his position after serving with the firm for twenty-one years),Mitch Lasky, andMatt Cohler(who each stepped back from their roles as partners after each spending more than a decade with the firm). The firm's most successful investment was a 1997 investment of $6.7 million ineBayfor 22.1% of the company.In 2011, it invested $12 million for an 11% stake inUber, worth $7 billion in 2019 and $9.4 billion in 2023. Benchmark’s first eight funds, raised and invested between 1995 and 2019, returned more than seven and a half times the money invested, net of fees andcarry. The firm has made exits from several companies,includingAmplitude,Asana,Confluent,eBay,Elastic,New Relic,Nextdoor,Red Hat,Snap,Stitch Fix,andUber. Benchmark Capital has faced scrutiny regarding its relationships with company founders and its role in leadership changes at portfolio companies. The firm's actions have raised questions about the balance between investor oversight and founder autonomy in venture capital. In August 2017, Benchmark filed a lawsuit against Uber co-founder and former CEOTravis Kalanick, alleging that he had misled the board in order to gain control of additional board seats.The lawsuit sought Kalanick's removal from Uber's board of directors and was described as \"unprecedented\" in Silicon Valley venture capital circles.The litigation was eventually dismissed in January 2018 as a condition of SoftBank's investment in Uber. Beyond Uber, Benchmark has been involved in leadership changes at multiple portfolio companies. According to media reports, Benchmark partnerBill Gurleyassisted the board atNextdoorin replacing founder Nirav Tolia as CEO.Additional reports have documented the firm's involvement in leadership changes at other portfolio companies, including solar technology company Nanosolar, where founder Martin Roscheisen was removed from his position. Roscheisen later characterized Benchmark as \"the backstabber of all founders\" and stated he would never accept investment from the firm again. The Uber lawsuit and other founder departures generated significant criticism within the startup community. Following the Uber litigation, several entrepreneurs expressed reluctance to work with Benchmark. Gabriel Puliatti, founder of startup Emptor, stated there was \"no way\" he would accept investment from Benchmark, saying he \"empathized a lot with Travis\" during the events. Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs predicted the lawsuit would have a \"chilling effect\" on the next generation of talent, with industry observers noting that Benchmark would have to answer \"awkward questions in a lot of deals for the foreseeable future.\"Investor Hazem Awad commented that \"any entrepreneur would naturally feel nervous about working with Benchmark, at least for the time being,\" citing concerns about \"what will happen if things get that bad.\" The controversy prompted discussion on social media, with entrepreneurs expressing concerns about Benchmark's approach to founder relations. One entrepreneur in Hong Kong, Larry Salibra, wrote that the \"cost of accepting investment from Benchmark just went through the roof in minds of founders everywhere.\" Delian Asparouhov ofFounders Fundcriticized Benchmark's approach, stating: \"I don't know how you explain to founders, 'Hey, the way I do early-stage investing is — I bet on founders,' and then you have this track record of explicitly not betting on founders.\"Asparouhov argued that venture capital firms with a history of removing founders could lose access to the most sought-after deals. Some industry observers defended Benchmark's actions as necessary corporate governance.Mark SusterofUpfront Venturesstated: \"There are people who are old enough and wise enough, to have a long enough lens, to say, 'You know what, governance matters.'\" Benchmark Capital was featured in theApple TV+original TV seriesWeCrashedstarringJared LetoandAnne Hathaway. In the show,Anthony Edwardsportrays Benchmark co-founder Bruce Dunlevie, who became WeWork's first major investor on the 1st of April in 2012 when Benchmark led WeWork's $17 million Series-A seed funding. Benchmark was also featured in theShowtimeoriginalSuper PumpedstarringJoseph Gordon-Levitt. In the series,Kyle Chandlerplays former Benchmark general partner Bill Gurley, portraying his involvement in leading Ubers' $11 million round of fundraising in February 2011.",

    "text": " Founders Fundis an Americanventure capitalfund formed in 2005 and based inSan Francisco. The fund has roughly $17 billion in totalassets under managementas of 2025.Founders Fund was the first institutional investor in Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) andPalantir Technologies, and an early investor inFacebook.The firm's partners have been founders, early employees and investors at companies includingPayPal,Palantir Technologies,Anduril Industriesand SpaceX. The firm's investments includeAirbnb,Anduril,DeepMind,Rippling,Facebook,Ramp,Palantir Technologies,Pudgy Penguins, SpaceX,Spotify,Stripe,Neuralink, andNubank. Notable partners includePeter Thiel,Trae Stephens, andMike Solana.Former partners includeBrian Singerman,Keith Rabois,Cyan Banister,Ken Howery,Kevin Hartz,Sean Parker,andBruce Gibney. The firm was organized byPeter Thiel,Ken Howery, andLuke Nosekin early 2005 and raised its firstfundof $50 million from individual entrepreneurs andangel investorsin January of that year.Sean Parker, co-founder ofNapsterand ex-president ofFacebook, joined in 2006.In 2007, the firm raised a new fund of $220 million. In 2010, the firm raised its third fund, with $250 million in committed capital,and in 2011, a fourth fund with $625 million of committed capital was raised. In 2014, Founders Fund raised a $1 billion fifth suite of funds, bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $2 billion. In 2016, Founders Fund raised a sixth, $1.3 billion fund, bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $3 billion. In 2020, Founders Fund raised a seventh flagship fund and its first growth fund, representing $3 billion in new capital and bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $6 billion. In 2022, Founders Fund raised an eighth flagship fund and its second growth fund, representing over $5 billion in new capital and bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $11 billion. In March 2023, Founders Fund cut the size of its eighth venture capital fund in half, from around $1.8 billion to around $900 million, to adapt to uncertain market conditions. This was the idea of Thiel, who thought \"venture capital is due for a slimdown\", which caused some resistance from inside the firm. In 2025, Founders Fund raised its third growth fund, Founders Fund Growth III, at $4.6 billion for late-stage investments.Julie Bort ofTechCrunchremarks that, \"Founders Fund is so big and successful that it can always raise an oversubscribed fund should it choose to.\" The oversubsription seemed to anticipate an era of big VC spending, and also expansion of the defense sector.Meanwhile,CNBCcommented that, \"Hefty amounts of private capital are likely to be needed for the foreseeable future as the IPO market remains virtually dormant\". The Founders Fund was conceptualized as an early-stage venture capital fund. From the start, it has adopted Thiel's contrarian attitude, and bet early and aggressively on companies with the founders it deemed deserving of trust. Early in its history, it made many investments in internet or social media and health and life science research, among which there were investments inSpotify,Airbnb, andLyft.By 2006, Jessica Guynn ofSFGatecharacterized it as a tiny but influential fund focusing on consumer internet, standing beside Thiel's then extraordinarily successful firmClarium Capital. Later, together with Thiel's disillusion with social media companies, the firm has gradually developed into a primary backer ofhard techand defense technology. In 2011, when the social bubble was still expanding, he complained, \"Is Twitter worth $7 billion?\" At this time, the Founders Fund had developed a portfolio in artificial intelligence, biotech and space technology. In 2017, it published the manifesto \"What happened to the future?\", written byBruce Gibney. The manifesto denied that the Internet's potential had been exhausted, but emphasized that the Founders' Fund would focus on ambitious projects that resolved real challenges. The original subtitle was Thiel's famous motto \"We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\" Julie Bort, the venture editor atTechcrunchremarks that it boasts perhaps the most formidable defense portfolio in the Silicon Valley.The Founders Fund,Andreessen Horowitz, America's Frontier Fund, as well as the leaders of these firms, namely Peter Thiel,Marc AndreessenandEric Schmidt, are often considered the dominance forces in the new defense tech domain.Camden Mead writes on the website of the Utah Aerospace and Defense Association that, together with Andreessen Horowitz, the Founders Fund \"has prioritized investing in revolutionary technologies, including various forms of autonomous vehicles. Both of these firms are relatively new to the defense space but are singlehandedly changing how traditional investors view the aerospace, deep tech, and defense ecosystem.\" The firm also turned to investing in companies in both early and later stages of development. Its first fund dedicated to late-stage startups was created in 2019.At the annual meeting in September 2025, partners indicated the firm’s third growth fund would invest about $460 million per company (with a total of 10 portfolio companies), compared with $225 million in its second fund (with 15 companies) and $55 million in its first (with 31 companies), showing a turn towards concentrated late-stage bets. Structure-wise, there are three directors, each with powers to veto over any deals over  $10 million.It is known, though, as in his other companies, that Thiel prefers to surround himself with people who share his thinking and loyal to him, and often manages to steer them to partnership, as seen in the cases of Keith Rabois,Sean Parker,Max Marmeror Trae Stephens.The tech writer Mario Gabrielewrites that, \"At the heart of Thiel’s power, influence, and wealth is Founders Fund. No organization has benefited more from his singular abilities, and those of the team he has assembled, than the venture firm.\" Thiel and other partners invest substantial amounts of their own money in the fund. Thiel contributed  $38 million  to the Founders Fund's Fund 1 (2005). In 2023, Thiel invested $920 million (27%). By late 2018, the firm was returning $4.60 to its investors on every dollar invested. The industry average of that year was $2.11. In October 2024, the Founders Fund hosted the invite-only \"Hereticon: Apocalypse Ball\", an event they described as \"a conference for thoughtcrime\", to display and celebrate \"technologies and projects so ambitious, they will ultimately transform our world for the better – or destroy it\". The invitation reads, \"Maybe if you are not trying to destroy the world, you are not trying hard enough\". The firm has a longtime rivalry with one of Thiel's other venture companies,Mithril Capital. In 2021, the Founders Fund opened aMiamioffice. The Founders Fund was co-founded by Thiel, Howery, and Nosek. Ken Howery, co-founder and former partner, was also a co-founder of PayPal and the Founders Fund's  first chief financial officer. At the Founders Fund, he led or co-led investments in Facebook,Quantcast,ZocDocandGeni. He is now a diplomat, having served asthe U.S. ambassador to Sweden, and has been confirmed by the Senate as the nextU.S. ambassador to DenmarkIn his college years, he was the editor-in-chief ofThe Stanford Review, a student newspaper found by Thiel. In 2017,Luke Nosek, one of the co-founders, left the Founders Fund to establish Gigafund, which focuses on space technology and Musk companies like Neuralink and theBoring Company(initially it mainly focused on SpaceX). The other Gigafund co-founder,  Stephen Oskoui, is also a former Founders Fund investor.When at Founders Fund. Nosek led the investment in SpaceX and remains a board member ever since.Nosek was instrumental in the investment, at a time SpaceX was vulnerable. Thiel was persuaded, partly out of the desire to mend his personal relationship with Musk due to previous problems atPayPal(Thiel had also previously refused to invest inTesla– Musk thinks it was because of his skepticism of climate change]. By April 2025, Peter Thiel, Napoleon Ta andTrae Stephensare listed as fund directors. Currently the sole female partner is Lauren Gross, also the COO, who leads all non-investment activities from legal to finance. Trae Stephens, also a partner, has played an important role in co-founding and developing companies incubated at the Founders Fund, includingAnduril Industries(where he is now chairman), Sol (at one point Sindarin Inc.), which develops a wearable e-reader,Varda Space Industries (co-founder, alongside Thiel fellow Delian Asparouhov and formerSpaceXengineer Will Bruey; also director),and Valinor Enterprises.  In 2024, he co-founded Valinor alongside former Palantir's senior vice president Julie Bush (CEO), General Catalyst's Paul Kwan and Red Cell's Grant Verstandig.The team is sourced fromPalantir Technologies,Anduril IndustriesandHelsing. The firm also holds strategic relationships with these companies.Valinor participates in Anduril's Lattice Partner Program,and the two companies are also members of the Defense Industrial Base Consortium.Stephens also sits on the board ofFlexport(he led the Founders Fund's investment in the company).Stephens had initially worked for Palantir.Alex Karp, the CEO, told him that he would not let Stephens meet Thiel because he would be poached from Palantir. Karp managed to keep the two separated for two years, until 2012. Stephens began to work for the Founders Fund in 2013.The Founders Fund's $1 billion investment in Anduril's 2025 Series G is the fund's largest investment in history, and the $2.5 billion collected in total was the second largest sum invested in a defense company in 2025, only behind the aerospace company's $2.6 billion Series E. Ryan PetersenofFlexportis a partner. In 2016, reacting to Peter Thiel's support for Trump, Petersen said that he regretted to have accepted investment from the Founders Fund.In 2023, he decided to join the fund though. Delian Asparouhov is currently a partner.AThiel fellow, he founded the space companyVarda Space Industriestogether with former SpaceX engineer Will Bruey. Varda works on in-space manufacturing, especially in-space drug manufacturing, and also provides a testbest for hypersonic technology as well as \"materials for heat shields, navigation systems and flight computers\" for theU.S. Department of Defense. In 2025, they raised $187 million in funding. The founders emphasize that the technologies they use are not new, what is new is the innovative model that combines all elements together.In 2025, the startup carried out a Mach 25 plus mission together with theAir Force Research Laboratory(AFRL) andNASA'sAmes Research Center.The Founders Fund is the incubator of the startup and one of its financial backers.In 2025, the Founders Fund invested $43 million in Asparouhov's home country Bulgaria's satellite startup EnduroSat. Scott Nolan is a partner. In 2025 he co-foundedGeneral Matter, a new nuclear fuel startup which he co-founds and which is considered the third part of a trilogy incubated at the Founders Fund (following Palantir and Anduril).When at SpaceX, Nolan helped to develop the Merlin engine systems and the Dragon capsule.He stays as a partner but will give his full focus on General Matter and the companies he has previously backed. Brian Singermanis a partner emeritus. He continues as strategic advisor and investor. He is seeking $500 million for a new fund named GPx. Mike Solanais the chief marketing officer. He is the founder ofPirate Wires. Keith Raboisis anotherPayPal Mafiamember. His connection with Thiel began when he served inThe Stanford Review's staff under Thiel (When Howery joined Stanford, Thiel and Rabois had graduated). He leftKhosla Venturesto join the Founders Fund in 2019. He returned to Khosla in 2024. Bruce Gibneyis also a formerStanford Revieweditor-in-chief. At Stanford, he was also Howery's roommate. He and his family were early investors inConfinity, which later formedPayPal. He worked for Thiel at Clarium Capital, where he advised Thiel on the $500,000 investment in Facebook. Later, he moved to the Founders Fund and worked as growth partner. He left in November 2012. He also works as a writer and litigator. Sean Parkerworked at the Founders Fund between 2006 and 2014. In 2010, when the Founders Fund invested inSpotify, he became a member of Spotify's board. He is also the founder of the Parker Foundation, an philanthropic organization. In 2016,Bloombergnoted that Founders Fund added roughly one member to their investment team per year.Cyan Banisterwas the Founders Fund's first female investing partner.In 2019, she helped organize a protest in solidarity withHong Kong protestersand urged Silicon Valley to sever the ties with China.She marriedPayPal MafiamemberScott Banister. Now she leads Long Journey Ventures alongside Arielle Zuckerberg, sister ofMark Zuckerberg. Tristan Abbey worked atClarium Capitaland the Founders Fund. He is currently the 11th administrator of theU.S. Energy Information Administration. He was an editor atThe Stanford Reviewtoo. Justin Fishner-Wolfson and S. Alexander Jacobson are former investors at Founders Fund. They are co-founders and partners at 137 Ventures (together with Kathy Chan, formerly at Khosla Ventures), which invests in Palantir, Anduril, SpaceX, Airbnb, Flexport. The Founders Fund have incubated or co-incubatedPalantir Technologies,Anduril Industries,General Matter, Valinor,Varda Space Industries, which are all defense company; only Sol is a non-military company.). Other than these companies andSpaceX, the Founders Fund makes investments in other notable companies or projects that have strategical value for defense, security or government affairs, including: Miles Kruppa revealed that Founders Fund was sitting on a more than $19.5 billion gain from its investment in SpaceX since it started investing in 2008—more than its total assets under management! Peter Thiel, the firm’s founder, lives in Los Angeles.\nAnd Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf told Jessica Lessin on TITV last week that its revenue would double—but it wasn’t yet making money. \"Growing a hardware company at the rate we’re growing at turns out to be really expensive,\" he said.\nThere’s a fascinating business story here about the reinvention of both the tech industry and the national defense complex. But there’s also something broader in the air: realpolitik. Tech is getting built and funded with an eye toward serving national interests and, importantly, getting close to power. Ideals only take you so far. Robotics is natural dual-use technology,but companies listed here have focused on civilian applications. In 2019,Cyan Banistercommented on the reason she and the Founders Fund continued to invest in game companies: \"In 2018 I was obsessed with the idea of how you can bring AI and entertainment together [...] I also became obsessed with live and interactive mobile-first entertainment, making investments in HQ Trivia, Drivetime, Bunch and Glamcam. When anyone says that consumer is over, I disagree. I believe we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift of how consumers behave and it's the beginning of new social fabric and design that pushes devices in ways never before thought imaginable.\"",

DST Global's founder isYuri Milnerand its co-founders are Saurabh Gupta, John Lindfors, Rahul Mehta and Tom Stafford.The company was founded in 2009 as a spinoff from Russian company Digital Sky Technologies, which becameMail.ru Group(later the VK company). In the early 2010s, DST Global international investments were focused on emerging markets such asChina. Yuri Milnerfounded Digital Sky Technologies (now known asVK) in 1999that through acquisitions has become a leading Russian language website in terms of users.In 2010, Digital Sky Technologies changed its name to Mail.ru Group and successfully completed aninitial public offeringon theLondon Stock Exchange.Although initial investments in American Internet companies were done by Mail.ru, it became clear that a dedicated fund management operation was required to continue investing at scale. As a result, DST Global was set up in 2009 by Yuri Milner as a separate fund management company for international investments.In 2012, Milner stepped down from his role asMail.ruChairman to fully focus on DST Global.In the capital of the third fund, Milner and Usmanov, as in the case of the second fund, contributed $50 million worth of Facebook shares. Special conditions were offered for investors of the first two funds. They could buy Facebook shares at a 12% discount to the \"internal valuation\" calculated using the DST method: at that time, the entire Facebook company was valued at $74 billion, for investors - $9 billion less. In addition, these investors paid fund managers 25% less than everyone else. In July 2015, the formation of the DST Global V fund began; by August, it had raised $1.7 billion. The composition of shareholders, as well as the final size of the fund, are unknown. The main capital was attracted from private sovereign funds and private individual investors. Since the Mail.ru Group's IPO, DST Global is the sole vehicle for further international investments. The company is now fully independent of Mail.ru Group. DST Global has offices inMenlo Park,New York,London, andHong Kong.The registered office of the DST Global funds is in theCayman Islands. Notable investments of the DST Global includeFacebook,Twitter,WhatsApp,Snapchat,Spotify,Alibaba,Toutiao/ByteDanceandXiaohongshu. A Kremlin-owned firm,VTB Bank, put $191 million into DST Global, which used it to buy a large share ofTwitterin 2011. A subsidiary of the Kremlin-controlledGazpromfunded an investment company that partnered with DST Global to buy shares inFacebook, reaping millions when the social media giant went public in 2012.Twittersimilarly went public in 2013. The US government sanctioned VTB in 2014 because of theRussian military intervention in Crimea, but DST Global had sold its stake in Twitter by then. Four days after the FacebookIPO, a DST Global subsidiary sold more than 27 million shares of Facebook for roughly $1 billion.In November 2017, DST Global issued the statement in response to this accusation: “Since 2009, DST Global has invested $7 billion in the consumer internet sector, with a majority being invested in non-U.S. companies — and with less than 5% coming from VTB Bank. VTB Bank was the only Russian government institution that invested in any DST Global funds... Moreover, there were dozens of DST Global investors making up the funds that invested in Facebook and Twitter — ....50 passive investors that invested in Facebook..., and VTB Bank was one of 40 passive investors... that invested in Twitter”Yuri Milner published his own open letter in ReCode magazine stated that \"DST Global's investments in Silicon Valley were motivated by pure business logic, based on a decade of experience in Internet technology... when we negotiated the Facebook and Twitter deals we asked for no board seats, and assigned all our votes to their founders, figuring they knew best how to run their companies. At the time, this structure was unusual, but it is core to DST Global's philosophy.\"DST Global funds have invested in over 80 companies, none of which are based in Russia. In 2022, due to additional sanctions being placed on Russia resulting from the2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, DST Global became a subject of scrutiny due to its ties to Russia.A DST Global representative stated that the firm had not raised capital from Russian limited partners since 2011.Less than 3% of capital it had raised from inception was from VTB Bank and all such capital was returned by 2014.On DST Global's website, the firm announced it condemned Russia's war against Ukraine.In addition the firm donated $3 million to Stand With Ukraine, aGoFundMeinitiative launched byMila KunisandAshton Kutcherto help the refugee and humanitarian relief efforts. Milner said, \"The great irony is that we are the least Russian fund right now and have been because we made a consistent effort.\" He toldBloomberg Newsthat DST hasn't taken money from Russia since a $900 million fund in 2011, and most Western banks were in business with Russia until years after he stopped.",

It was founded in 1985 as amergers and acquisitionsfirm byPeter PetersonandStephen Schwarzman, who had previously worked together atLehman Brothers. Blackstone'sprivate equitybusiness has been one of the largest investors inleveraged buyoutsin the last three decades, while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate across the globe. Blackstone is also active in credit, infrastructure,hedge funds, secondaries, growth equity, and insurance solutions. As of September 30, 2025, Blackstone has $1.2 trillion in totalassets under management, making it the world's largest alternative investment firm. Blackstone was founded in 1985 byPeter G. PetersonandStephen A. SchwarzmanwithUS$400,000(equivalent to $1.2million in 2024) inseed capital.The founders derived their firm's name from their names: \"Schwarz\" is German for \"black\"; \"Peter\", \"petros\" (πέτρος, masculine), or \"petra\" (πετρα, feminine) means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in Greek.The two founders had previously worked together atLehman Brothers. There, Schwarzman served as head of global mergers and acquisitions business.Prominent investment bankerRoger C. Altman, another Lehman veteran, left his position as a managing director ofLehman Brothersto join Peterson and Schwarzman at Blackstone in 1987, but left in 1992 to join theClinton administrationasDeputy Treasury Secretaryand later founded advisory investment bankEvercore Partnersin 1995. Blackstone was originally formed as a mergers and acquisitions advisory boutique. It advised on the 1987 merger of investment banksE. F. Hutton & Co.and Shearson Lehman Brothers, collecting a $3.5 million fee. From the outset in 1985, Schwarzman and Peterson planned to enter the private equity business but had difficulty in raising their first fund because neither had ever led a leveraged buyout.Blackstone finalized fundraising for its first private equity fund in the aftermath ofBlack Monday, the October 1987 global stock market crash. After two years of providing strictly advisory services, Blackstone decided to pursue a merchant banking model after its founders determined that many situations required an investment partner rather than just an advisor. The largest investors in the first fund includedPrudential Insurance Company,Nikko Securitiesand theGeneral Motorspension fund. Blackstone also ventured into other businesses, most notably investment management. In 1987 Blackstone entered into a 50–50 partnership with the founders ofBlackRock,Larry Fink(current CEO of BlackRock), and Ralph Schlosstein (CEO ofEvercore). The two founders, who had previously run the mortgage-backed securities divisions atFirst Bostonand Lehman Brothers, respectively, initially joined Blackstone to manage an investment fund and provide advice to financial institutions. They also planned to use a Blackstone fund to invest in financial institutions and help build an asset management business specializing in fixed income investments. As the business grew, Japanese bank Nikko Securities acquired a 20% interest in Blackstone for a $100 million investment in 1988 (valuing the firm at $500 million). Nikko's investment allowed for a major expansion of the firm and its investment activities.The growth firm also recruited politician and investment bankerDavid StockmanfromSalomon Brothersin 1988. Stockman led many key deals in his time at the firm but had a mixed record with his investments.He left Blackstone in 1999 to start his own private equity firm,Heartland Industrial Partners, based inGreenwich, Connecticut. The firm advisedCBS Corporationon its 1988 sale of CBS Records toSonyto form what would becomeSony Music Entertainment.In June 1989, Blackstone acquired freight railroad operatorCNW Corporation.The same year, Blackstone partnered with Salomon Brothers to raise $600 million to acquire distressedthriftsin the midst of thesavings and loan crisis. In 1990, Blackstone launched its hedge funds business, initially intended to manage investments for Blackstone senior management.The same year, Blackstone formed a partnership with J. O. Hambro Magan in the UK andIndosuezin France.Blackstone and Silverman also acquired a 65% interest in Prime Motor Inn'sRamadaandHoward Johnsonfranchises for $140 million, creating Hospitality Franchise Systems as aholding company. In 1991, Blackstone created its Europe unitand launched its real estate investment business with the acquisition of a series of hotel businesses underHenry Silverman's leadership. In October 1991, Blackstone and Silverman addedDays Inns of Americafor $250 million.In 1993, Hospitality Franchise Systems acquiredSuper 8 Motelsfor $125 million.Silverman left Blackstone to serve as CEO of HFS, which later becameCendant Corporation. Blackstone made a number of notable investments in the early and mid-1990s, includingGreat Lakes Dredge and Dock Company(1991),Six Flags(1991), US Radio (1994),Centerplate(1995),MEGA Brands(1996). Also, in 1996, Blackstone partnered with theLoewen Group, the second-largest funeral home and cemetery operator in North America, to acquire funeral home and cemetery businesses. The partnership's first acquisition was a $295 million buyout of Prime Succession fromGTCR. In 1995, Blackstone sold its stake in BlackRock toPNC Financial Servicesfor $240 million. Between 1995 and 2014, PNC reported $12 billion in pretax revenues and capital gains from BlackRock. Schwarzman later described the selling of BlackRock as his worst business decision ever. In 1997, Blackstone completed fundraising for its third private equity fund, with approximately $4 billion of investor commitmentsand a $1.1-billion real estate investment fund.Also in 1997, Blackstone made its first investment inAllied Waste.In 1998, Blackstone sold a 7% interest in its management company toAIG, valuing Blackstone at $2.1 billion.In 1999, Blackstone partnered withApollo Managementto provide capital for Allied Waste's acquisition ofBrowning-Ferris Industries. Blackstone's investment in Allied was one of its largest at that point in the firm's history. In 1999, Blackstone launched its mezzanine capital business. It brought in five professionals, led by Howard Gellis from Nomura Holding America's Leveraged Capital Group, to manage the business. Blackstone's investments in the late 1990s includedAMF Group(1996),Haynes International(1997),American Axle(1997),Premcor(1997), CommNet Cellular (1998), Graham Packaging (1998),Centennial Communications(1999),Bresnan Communications(1999), andPAETEC Holding Corp.(1999).

Blackstone's investments in telecommunications businesses—four cable TV systems in rural areas (TW Fanch 1 and 2, Bresnan Communications and Intermedia Partners IV) and a cell phone operator in the Rocky Mountain states (CommNet Cellular) were among the most successful of the era, generating $1.5 billion of profits for Blackstone's funds.

In May 2011, Southern Cross, now independent, was almost bankrupt, jeopardizing 31,000 elderly residents in 750 care homes.

On December 1, 2022, Blackstone restricted withdrawals from its $125-billion real estate investment fundBREIT(Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust) due to a surge in redemption requests from investors.The move caused investor consternation and limited the ability to attract new capital for BREIT. In November 2024, Blackstone acquired a group of four retail buildings inSohofor approximately $200 million from ASB Real Estate Investments. This transaction marked the largest Manhattan retail deal by an investor in over three years, signaling a resurgence in the retail asset class.

In 2020, Blackstone acquired a majority stake in Ancestry.com, which controls access to millions of people's genetic data, heightening concern about Blackstone's data privacy practices.This data was disclosed to Blackstone, and it has aggressively defended itself against class action litigation relating to misuse of the data of people who did not consent to genetic testing but were affected through direct biological relations or other means of identification. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor showed thatmore than 100 American children had been working illegally for Packers Sanitation Services Inc.(PSSI), a slaughterhouse cleaning firm owned by Blackstone. The investigation began after a Walnut Middle School teacher inGrand Island, Nebraska, reported a student with hydrochloric acid burns on his hands and knees to the Department of Labor.Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Labor Department fined PSSI $15,138 for each minor who was employed in breach of the law, totaling $1.5 million in civil money penalties.

In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including, in 1991, a $500 million investment in Citigroup byPrince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of theSaudi royal family. Carlyle developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry.  In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.Carlyle would sell the business toTracorin October 1994.Carlyle acquiredMagnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, fromPhilips Electronicsin 1993.Carlyle sold Magnavox for about $370 million toHughes Aircraft Companyin 1995.  Carlyle also invested inVought Aircraftthrough a partnership withNorthrop Grumman.Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition ofUnited Defense Industries.  The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.Carlyle completed an IPO of United Defense on theNew York Stock Exchangein December 2001, then sold the rest of the stock in April 2004.In more recent years, Carlyle has invested less in the defense industry. Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001.  In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported thatShafiq bin Laden, a member of theBin Laden family, had been the \"guest of honor\", and that they were investors in Carlyle-managed funds.Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.These connections would later be profiled inMichael Moore'sFahrenheit 9/11.  The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11 attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic. Buyouts declined after the collapse of thedot-com bubblein 2000 and 2001. But after the two-stage buyout ofDex Mediaat the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain high-yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together withWelsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex,the third-largest corporate buyout since 1989.QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003.R. H. Donnelley Corporationacquired Dex Media in 2006. Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO ofIBMandNabisco, replacedFrank Carluccias chairman of Carlyle in January 2003.Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.The hiring of Gerstner was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier, had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%. Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition ofHawaiian TelcomfromVerizonin May 2004.Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout.  The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems.  Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company. As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors asKKR,Blackstone Group, andTPG Capital.  In 2005, Carlyle, together withClayton, Dubilier & RiceandMerrill Lynchcompleted the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout ofThe Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency fromFord. The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and itsRiverstone Holdingsaffiliate partnered withGoldman Sachs Capital Partnersin the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition ofKinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US.The buyout was backed byRichard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president ofEnron. In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprisingBlackstone Group,PermiraandTPG Capital, in the  $17.6 billion takeover ofFreescale Semiconductor.  At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout ofSunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain. Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together withBlackstone Group,AlpInvest Partners,Hellman & Friedman,KKRandThomas H. Lee PartnersacquiredNielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.Also in 2006, Carlyle acquiredOriental Trading Companywhich ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner ofSmall Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.

In January 2021, the Carlyle Group acquired a majority stake inJagex, a Britishvideo game developmentstudio known for themassively multiplayer online gameRuneScape. In May 2021, the Carlyle Group entered a partnership agreement withSPX Capitalto enter the Brazilian market.

In March 2022, the Carlyle Group acquiredDainese- an Italian motorcycle kit and clothing company fromInvestcorp.Following this in May 2022, the Carlyle Group announced the acquisition deal of US government contractor for cyber security and IT defence,ManTech International. The deal, worth $3.9 billion, will include the firm to buyout shares at $96 a share, representing a 32% premium to ManTech's closing price on February 2, 2022. The acquisition aimed to increase the firms steady stream of recurring revenue.

In November 2025, it was announced Carlyle had acquired theLiverpool, UK-headquartered multi-brand online retailer and financial services provider,The Very Groupfor an undisclosed amount. For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners.  In 2001, theCalifornia Public Employees' Retirement System(CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.The investment was valued at about $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom. In September 2007,Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government ofAbu Dhabiof theUnited Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion. In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubadala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money \"with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights.\"  The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development, was later withdrawn. In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on theNASDAQ.  The firm, which at the time managed about $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering.

Metropolitan was sold in 2021 toBentallGreenOak. Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures. In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation – established in August 2006for the purpose of making investments in U.S.mortgage-backed securities– defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by thesubprime mortgage crisisworsened for leveraged investors. TheGuernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expected its creditors to seize its remaining assets.Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to makemargin callsor to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, theFederal Reservegave Wall Street'sprimary dealersthe right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities. On March 12, 2008,BBC News Onlinereported that \"instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset\" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. \"will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets.\"On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition  under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernseyfor a \"compulsory winding up proceeding\" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator. The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be \"minimal from a financial standpoint\". In September 2017, the court ruled that Carlyle had no liability in the lawsuit. Carlyle has been profiled inMichael Moore'sFahrenheit 9/11andWilliam Karel'sThe World According to Bush. InFahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.Moore focused on Carlyle's connections withGeorge H. W. Bushand his Secretary of StateJames Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes authorDan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group \"gained\" from theSeptember 11 attacksbecause it owned military contractorUnited Defense.A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several otherprivate equity firms. InThe World According to Bush,William KarelinterviewedFrank Carluccito discuss the presence ofShafiq bin Laden,Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.",

    "text": " Apollo Global Management, Inc.is an Americanasset management firmthat primarily invests inalternative assets.As of 2025, the company had $840 billion of assets under management, including $392 billion invested in credit, includingmezzanine capital,hedge funds,non-performing loans, andcollateralized loan obligations, $99 billion invested inprivate equity, and $46.2 billion invested in real assets, which includesreal estateandinfrastructure. The company invests money on behalf ofpension funds,financial endowments, andsovereign wealth funds, as well as other institutional and individual investors. Apollo was founded in 1990 byLeon Black,Josh Harris, andMarc Rowan, former investment bankers at the defunctDrexel Burnham Lambert. The company is headquartered in theSolow BuildinginNew York City,with offices across North America, Europe, and Asia.Founder and CEO Leon Black resigned as CEO in 2021 in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations and revelations that he had paid $158 million toJeffrey Epstein. In addition to its private funds, Apollo operates Apollo Investment Corporation (AIC), a US-domiciledpublicly traded, private-equity,closed-end fundandBusiness Development Company. AIC providesmezzanine debt, seniorsecured loans, and equity investments tomiddle-market companies, including public companies, although it historically has not invested in companies controlled by Apollo's private-equity funds. In June 2024, Apollo Global Management ranked 29th inPrivate Equity International'sPEI 300 ranking among the world's largest private equity firms. Apollo, originally referred to as Apollo Advisors, was founded after the collapse ofDrexel Burnham Lambertin 1990 byLeon Black, the former head of Drexel's mergers and acquisitions department, along withJosh HarrisandMarc Rowan.Tony Ressler, another former senior Drexel executive, was also among the firm's original members. Within six months after the collapse of Drexel, Apollo launched Apollo Investment Fund L.P., the first of its private-equity investment funds, formed to make investments in distressed companies. Apollo raised around $400 million of investor commitments based on Leon Black's reputation as a prominent lieutenant ofMichael Milkenand a key player in thebuyout boom of the 1980s. Lion Advisors (or Lion Capital) was founded in 1990 to provide investment services to Credit Lyonnais and foreign institutions, seeking to profit from depressed prices in the high-yield market.In 1992, Lion entered into a more formal arrangement to manage the $3 billion high-yield portfolio for Credit Lyonnais which together with a consortium of other international investors provided the capital for Lion's investment activities. Lion Advisors was replaced byAres Management. At the time of Apollo's founding, little financing was available for newleveraged buyoutsand Apollo turned, instead, to a strategy of distressed-to-control takeovers.Apollo purchaseddistressed securities, which could be converted into a controlling interest in the equity of the company through a bankruptcy reorganization or other restructuring. Apollo used distressed debt as an entry point, enabling the firm to invest in such firms asVail Resorts,Walter Industries,Culligan, andSamsonite. Apollo acquired interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasinghigh-yield bondsfrom failedsavings and loansand insurance companies. Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from the U.S. government'sResolution Trust Corporation.One of Apollo's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company's bond portfolio. Using this vehicle, Apollo purchased the Executive Life portfolio, profiting when the value of high-yield bonds recovered, but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase. In 1993, Apollo Real Estate Advisers was founded in collaboration with William Mack to seek opportunities in the U.S. property markets. In April 1993, Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund, L.P., the first in a family of real estate \"opportunity funds\", was closed with $500 million of investor commitments. In 2000, Apollo exited the partnership, which continued to operate as Apollo Real Estate Advisers until changing its name to AREA Property Partners effective January 15, 2009. That firm was then owned and controlled by its remaining principals, including William Mack, Lee Neibart, William Benjamin, John Jacobsson, Stuart Koenig, and Richard Mack. In 1995, Apollo raised its third private-equity fund, Apollo Investment Fund III, with $1.5 billion of investor commitments from investors that includedCalPERSand theGeneral Motorspension fund.Fund III was only an average performer for private-equity funds of its vintage. Among the investments made in Fund III (invested through 1998) were: Alliance Imaging,Allied Waste Industries,Breuners Home Furnishings,Levitz Furniture,Communications Corporation of America,Dominick's,Ralphs(acquired Apollo'sFood-4-Less),Move.com,NRT Incorporated,Pillowtex Corporation,Telemundo,andWMC Mortgage Corporation. Also in 1995, Apollo's founding partner Craig Cogut left the firm to found Pegasus Capital Advisors. Since its inception, Pegasus has raised $1.8 billion in four private-equity funds focused on investments inmiddle-market companiesin financial distress. In 1997,Ares Managementwas founded by Antony Ressler and John H. Kissick, both partners at Apollo, as well as Bennett Rosenthal, who joined the group from the global leveraged finance group atMerrill Lynch, to manage a $1.2 billion market valuecollateralized debt obligation vehicle.Ares I and II which were raised were structured asmarket value CLOs. Ares III-Ares X were structured ascash flow CLOs. In 2002, Ares completed acorporate spin-offfrom Apollo management. Although technically the founders of Ares had completed a spinout with the formation of the firm in 1997, they had maintained a close relationship with Apollo over its first five years and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo. Shortly thereafter, Ares completed fundraising for Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund, a special-situations investment fund with $750 million of capital under management. In 1998, during thedot-com bubble, Apollo raised Apollo Investment Fund IV with $3.6 billion of investor commitments. As of April 8, 2008, the fund had generated a 10% IRR net of fees.Among the investments made in Fund IV (invested through 2001) were:Allied Waste Industries,AMC Entertainment,Berlitz International,Clark Retail Enterprises,Corporate Express(Buhrmann), Encompass Services Corporation, National Financial Partners,Pacer International,Rent-A-Center,Resolution Performance Products,Resolution Specialty Materials,Sirius Satellite Radio,SkyTerra Communications,United Rentals, andWyndham Worldwide. In April 2001, Apollo raised Apollo Investment Fund V with $3.7 billion of investor commitments.

Although the founders of Ares had completed acorporate spin-offwith the formation of the firm in 1997, they had initially maintained a close relationship with Apollo and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo.. In 2002, when Ares raised its first corporate opportunities fund, the firm announced that it would separate from its former parent company. The timing of this separation also coincided with Apollo's legal difficulties with the State of California over its purchase ofExecutive Life Insurance Companyin 1991.The same year,Attorney General of CaliforniaBill Lockyeraccused Leon and an investor group led by French bankCredit Lyonnaisof violating California law by having a foreign government-owned bank acquire the assets and bond portfolio of Executive Life Insurance.

Hexion announced in July 2007 that it was acquiringHuntsman Corporation, a major specialty-chemicals company, in a $6.5 billion leveraged buyout. Hexion announced in June 2008 it would refuse to close the deal, prompting a series of legal actions. The transaction was terminated in December after a settlement between Hexion and Huntsman, wherein they were required to pay Huntsman $1 billion to drop fraud charges.

AAA was formed to invest alongside Apollo's main private-equity funds and hedge funds.AAA's investment portfolio was made up of a mix of private-equity and capital-markets investments.

In late 2008, Apollo receivedmargin callsassociated with the financing of its purchase of certain loan portfolios as the values of the loans decreased.

During the2008 financial crisis, several of Apollo's investments came under pressure.

In May 2008, Linens filed for bankruptcy protection, costing Apollo all of its $365 million investment in the company.In 2009, the company was sued by a noteholder claiming mismanagement.

Bain Capital invests across a range of industry sectors and geographic regions.The firm was founded in 1984 by partners from the consulting firmBain & Company.The company is headquartered at200 Clarendon Streetin Boston with 24 offices in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Since its establishment, Bain Capital has invested in or acquired hundreds of companies, includingAMC Theatres,Artisan Entertainment,Aspen Education Group,Apex Tool Group,Brookstone,Burger King,Burlington Coat Factory,Canada Goose,DIC Entertainment,Domino's Pizza,DoubleClick,Dunkin' Donuts,D&M Holdings,Guitar Center,Hospital Corporation of America (HCA),iHeartMedia,ITP Aero,KB Toys,Sealy,Sports Authority,Staples,Toys \"R\" Us,Virgin Australia,Virgin Voyages,Warner Music Group,Fingerhut,Athenahealth,The Weather Channel,Varsity BrandsandApple Leisure Group, which includes AMResorts and Apple Vacations.The company and its actions during its first 15 years became the subject of political and media scrutiny as a result of co-founderMitt Romney's later political career, especiallyhis 2012 presidential campaign. In June 2023, Bain Capital was ranked 13th inPrivate Equity International's PEI 300 ranking of the largest private equity firms in the world. Bain Capital was founded in 1984 byBain & CompanypartnersMitt Romney, T. Coleman Andrews III, andEric Kriss, afterBill Bainhad offered Romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply Bain's consulting techniques to improve operations.In addition to the three founding partners, the early team includedFraser Bullock,Robert F. White,Joshua Bekenstein, Adam Kirsch, and Geoffrey S. Rehnert.Romney initially held the titles of presidentand managing general partneror managing partner.He later became referred to as managing directoror CEOas well. He was also the sole shareholder of the firm.At the time, the firm had fewer than ten employees. In the face of skepticism from potential investors, Romney and his partners spent a year raising the $37 million in funds needed to start the new operation.Bain partners put in $12 million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals.Early investors included Boston real estate mogulMortimer ZuckermanandRobert Kraft, the owner of theNew England Patriots football team.They also included members of elite Salvadoran families such asRicardo Pomawhose capital fled the country'scivil war.They and other wealthy Latin Americans invested $9 million primarily throughoffshore companiesregistered inPanama. While Bain Capital was founded by Bain executives, the firm was not an affiliate or a division of Bain & Company but rather a completely separate company. Initially, the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower atCopley Placein Boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations. However, the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the Bain & Company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest.Bain Capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of Bain & Company. The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain & Company, but Romney later persuaded Bill Bain to give that up. The Bain Capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital. By 1985, things were going poorly enough that Romney considered closing the operation, returning investors' money to them, and having the partners go back to their old positions.The partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by 1986, very few had been done. At first, Bain Capital focused onventure capitalopportunities.One of Bain's earliest and most notable venture investments was inStaples, Inc., theoffice supplyretailer. In 1986, Bain provided $4.5 million to two supermarket executives, Leo Kahn andThomas G. Stemberg, to open an office supply supermarket inBrighton, Massachusetts.The fast-growing retail chain went public in 1989;by 1996, the company had grown to over 1,100 stores,and as of fiscal year-end January 2012, Staples reached over $20 billion in sales, nearly $1.0B in net income, 87,000 employees, and 2,295 stores.Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade.Another very successful investment occurred in 1986 when $1 million was invested in medical equipment maker Calumet Coach, which eventually returned $34 million.A few years later, Bain Capital made an investment in the technology research outfit theGartner Group, which ended up returning a 16-fold gain. Bain invested the $37 million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by 1989 was generating an annualized return in excess of 50 percent. By the end of the decade, Bain's second fund, raised in 1987 had deployed $106 million into 13 investments.As the firm began organizing around funds, each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all Bain Capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by Bain Capital Inc., the management company that Romney had full ownership control of.As CEO, Romney had a final say in every deal made. In the 1990s, Bain Capital started several affiliates that supported its private equity and other assets classes. The long-short equity hedge fund, Brookside Capital, was founded in 1996 and, Sankaty Advisors, the company's fixed income affiliate, was started two years later.Building affiliates for the firm was directed by three conditions: that it leveraged its core skills; one of its Managing Directors has a leadership role; and, the new business invests in attractive asset class. Beginning in 1989, the firm, which began as aventure capitalsource investing instart-up companies, adjusted its strategy to focus onleveraged buyoutsandgrowth capitalinvestments in more mature companies.Their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets, partner with existing management to apply Bain methodology to their operations (rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios), and sell them off in a few years.Existing CEOs were offered large equity stakes in the process, owing to Bain Capital's belief in the emergingagency theorythat CEOs should be bound to maximizingshareholder valuerather than other goals.By the end of 1990, Bain had raised $175 million of capital and financed 35 companies with combined revenues of $3.5 billion. In July 1992, Bain acquiredAmpad(originally American Pad & Paper) fromMead Corporation, which had acquired the company in 1986. Mead, which had been experiencing difficulties integrating Ampad's products into its existing product lines, generated a cash gain of $56 million on the sale.Under Bain's ownership, the company enjoyed a significant growth in sales from $106.7 million in 1992 to $583.9 million in 1996, when the company was listed on theNew York Stock Exchange. Under Bain's ownership, the company also made a number of acquisitions, including writing products companySCMin July 1994, brand names from the American Trading and Production Corporation in August 1995, WR Acquisition and the Williamhouse-Regency Division of Delaware, Inc. in October 1995, Niagara Envelope Company, Inc. in 1996, and Shade/Allied, Inc. in February 1997.Ampad's revenue began to decline in 1997, and the company laid off employees and closed production facilities to maintain profitability. Employment declined from 4,105 in 1996 to 3,800 in 2000.The company ceased trading on the New York stock exchange on December 22, 2000,and filed for bankruptcy in 2001. At the time of the bankruptcy, Bain Capital held a 34.9% equity ownership interest in the company.The assets were acquired in 2003 byCrescent Investments. Bain's eight years' of involvement in Ampad is estimated to have generated over $100 million in profits ($60 million in dividends, $45–50 million from the proceeds from stock issued after the company went public, and $1.5-2 million in annual management fees). In 1994, Bain acquiredTotes, a producer of umbrellas and overshoes.Three years later, Totes, under Bain's ownership, acquired Isotoner, a producer of leather gloves. Bain, together withThomas H. Lee Partners, acquiredExperian, the consumer credit reporting business ofTRW Inc., in 1996 for more than $1 billion. Formerly known as TRW's Information Systems and Services unit, Experian is one of the leading providers of credit reports on consumers and businesses in the US.The company was sold toGreat Universal Storesfor $1.7 billion just months after being acquired.Other notable Bain investments of the late 1990s, includedSealy Corporation, the manufacturer of mattresses;Alliance Laundry Systems;Domino's Pizzaand Artisan Entertainment. Much of the firm's profits was earned from a relatively small number of deals, with Bain Capital's overall success and failure rate being about even. One study of 68 deals that Bain Capital made up through the 1990s found that the firm lost money or broke even on 33 of them.Another study that looked at the eight-year period following 77 deals during the same time found that in 17 cases the company went bankrupt or out of business, and in 6 cases Bain Capital lost all its investment. But 10 deals were very successful and represented 70 percent of the total profits. Romney had two diversions from Bain Capital during the first half of the decade. From January 1991 to December 1992,Romney was the CEO ofBain & Companywhere he led the successful turnaround of the consulting firm (he remained managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time).In November 1993, he took a leave of absence for his unsuccessful1994 run for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts; he returned the day after the election in November 1994.During that time, Ampad workers went on strike, and asked Romney to intervene; Bain Capital lawyers asked him not to get involved, although he did meet with the workers to tell them he had no position of active authority in the matter. In 1994, Bain invested inSteel Dynamics, based inFort Wayne, Indiana, a prosperous steel company that has grown to the fifth largest in the US, employs about 6,100 people, and produces carbon steel products with 2010 revenues of $6.3 billion on steel shipments of 5.3 million tons.In 1993, Bain acquired theArmco Worldwide Grinding Systemsteel plant inKansas City, Missouriand merged it with its steel plant inGeorgetown, South Carolinato formGST Steel. The Kansas City plant had a strike in 1997 and Bain closed the plant in 2001, laying off 750 workers when it went into bankruptcy. TheSouth Carolinaplant closed in 2003 but subsequently reopened under a different owner. At the time of its bankruptcy it reported $553.9 million in debts against $395.2 in assets. Bain reported $58.4 million in profits, the employee pension fund had a liability of $44 million. Bain's investment inDade Behringrepresented a significant investment in themedical diagnosticsindustry. In 1994, Bain, together withGoldman Sachs Capital Partnerscompleted a carveout acquisition of Dade International,the medical diagnostics division ofBaxter Internationalin a $440 million acquisition. Dade's private equity owners merged the company with DuPont'sin vitrodiagnostics business in May 1996 and subsequently with the Behring Diagnostics division ofHoechst AGin 1997.Aventis, the successor of Hoechst, acquired 52% of the combined company.In 1999, the company reported $1.3 billion of revenue and completed a $1.25 billionleveraged recapitalizationthat resulted in a payout to shareholders.The dividend, taken together with other previous shareholder dividends resulted in an eightfold return on investment to Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs.Revenues declined from 1999 through 2002 and despite attempts to cut costs through layoffs the company entered into bankruptcy in 2002. Following its restructuring, Dade Behring emerged from Bankruptcy in 2003 and continued to operate independently until 2007 when the business was acquired bySiemens Medical Solutions. Bain and Goldman lost their remaining stock in the company as part of the bankruptcy. By the end of the decade, Bain Capital was on its way to being one of the top private equity firms in the nation,having increased its number of partners from 5 to 18, having 115 employees overall, and having $4 billion under its management.The firm's average annual return on investments was 113 percent.It had made between 100 and 150 deals where it acquired and then sold a company. Romney took a paid leave of absence from Bain Capital in February 1999, when he became the head of theSalt Lake Organizing Committeefor the2002 Winter Olympics.The decision caused turmoil at Bain Capital, with a power struggle ensuing.Some partners left and founded the Audax Group andGolden Gate Capital.Other partners threatened to leave, and there was a prospect of eight-figure lawsuits being filed.Romney was worried that the firm might be destroyed, but the crisis ebbed. Romney was not involved in day-to-day operations of the firm after starting the Olympics position.Those were handled by a management committee, consisting of five of the fourteen remaining active partners with the firm.However, according to some interviews and press releases during 1999, Romney said he was keeping a part-time function at Bain. During his leave of absence, Romney continued to be listed in filings to theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionas \"sole shareholder, sole director, Chief Executive Officer and President\".The SEC filings reflected the legal realityand the ownership interest in the Bain Capital management company.In practice, former Bain partners have stated that Romney's attention was mostly occupied by his Olympics position.He did stay in regular contact with his partners, and traveled to meet with them several times, signing corporate and legal documents and paying attention to his own interests within the firm and to his departure negotiations.Bain Capital Fund VI in 1998 was the last one Romney was involved in; investors were worried that with Romney gone, the firm would have trouble raising money for Bain Capital Fund VII in 2000, but in practice the $2.5 billion was raised without much trouble.His former partners have said that Romney had no role in assessing other new investments after February 1999,nor was he involved in directing the company's investment funds.Discussions over the final terms of Romney's departure dragged on during this time, with Romney negotiating for the best deal he could get and his continuing position as CEO and sole shareholder giving him the leverage to do so. Although he had left open the possibility of returning to Bain after the Olympics, Romney made his crossover to politics in 1999.His separation from the firm was finalized in early 2002.Romney negotiated a ten-year retirement agreement with Bain Capitalthat allowed him to receive a passive profit share and interest as a retired partner in some Bain Capital entities, including buyout and Bain Capital investment funds, in exchange for his ownership in the management company.Because the private equity business continued to thrive, this deal would bring him millions of dollars in annual income.Romney was the first and last CEO of Bain Capital; since his departure became final, it has continued to be run by management committee. Bain Capital itself, and especially its actions and investments during its first 15 years, came under press scrutiny as the result of Romney's2008and2012 presidential campaigns,including accusations ofAsset Stripping.Romney's leave of absence and the level of activity he had within the firm during the 1999-2002 period also garnered attention. In 2000,DIC Entertainmentchairman and CEOAndy Heywardpartnered with Bain Capital Inc in a management buyout of DIC fromThe Walt Disney Company.Heyward continued as chairman and CEO of the animation studio, which has more than 2,500 half-hours of programming in its library. He purchased Bain Capital's interest in 2004 and took the company public the following year. Bain Capital began the new decade by closing on its seventh fund, Bain Capital Fund VII, with over $3.1 billion of investor commitments. The firm's most notable investments in 2000 included the $700 million acquisition of Datek, sold toTD Ameritradein 2002,as well as the $305 million acquisition ofKB ToysfromConsolidated Stores.KB Toys, which had been financially troubled since the 1990s as a result of increased pressure from national discount chains such asWalmartandTarget, filed forChapter 11bankruptcy protection in January 2004. Bain had been able to recover value on its investment through adividend recapitalizationin 2003.In early 2001, Bain agreed to purchase a 30 percent stake, worth $600 million, inHuntsman Corporation, a leading chemical company owned byJon Huntsman, Sr., but the deal was never completed. With a significant amount of committed capital in its new fund available for investment, Bain was one of a handful of private equity investors capable of completing large transactions in the adverse conditions of theearly 2000s recession. In July 2002, Bain together withTPG CapitalandGoldman Sachs Capital Partners, announced the high-profile $2.3 billion leveraged buyout ofBurger KingfromDiageo.However, in November the original transaction collapsed when Burger King failed to meet certain performance targets. In December 2002, Bain and its co-investors agreed on a reduced $1.5 billion purchase price for the investment.The Bain consortium had support from Burger King's franchisees, who controlled approximately 92% of Burger King restaurants at the time of the transaction. Under its new owners,Burger Kingunderwent a major brand overhaul including the use ofThe Burger Kingcharacter in advertising. In February 2006, Burger King announced plans for aninitial public offering. In late 2002, Bain remained active acquiringHoughton Mifflinfor $1.28 billion, together withThomas H. Lee PartnersandBlackstone Group. Houghton Mifflin and Burger King represented two of the first largeclub deals, completed since the collapse of theDot-com bubble. In November 2003, Bain completed an investment inWarner Music Groupthrough an acquisition by Edgar Bronfman Jr.In 2004 Bain acquired theDollaramachain ofdollar stores, based inMontreal,Quebec, Canada and operating stores in the provinces ofEastern Canadafor $1.05 billionCAD. In March 2004, Bain acquired Brenntag Group from Deutsche Bahn AG (Exited in 2006; sold toBC Partnersfor $4B). In August 2003, Bain acquired a 50% interest inBombardier Inc.'s recreational products division, along with the Bombardier family and theCaisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, and createdBombardier Recreational Productsor BRP. In 2004 aconsortiumcomprising KKR, Bain Capital, and real estate development companyVornado Realty Trustannounced the $6.6 billion acquisition ofToys \"R\" Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier,Cerberus Capital Management, made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses.The Toys 'R' Us buyout was one of the largest in several years.Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts. The following year, in 2005, Bain was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout ofSunGardin a transaction valued at $11.3 billion.Bain's partners in the acquisition wereSilver Lake Partners,TPG Capital,Goldman Sachs Capital Partners,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,Providence Equity Partners, andBlackstone Group. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover ofRJR Nabiscoat the end of the 1980s, leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout ofFreescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largestclub dealcompleted to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive. Bain led a consortium, together withThe Carlyle GroupandThomas H. Lee Partnersto acquireDunkin' Brands. The private equity firms paid $2.425 billion in cash for the parent company ofDunkin' DonutsandBaskin-Robbinsin December 2005. In 2006, Bain Capital andKohlberg Kravis Roberts, together withMerrill Lynchand the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $31.6 billion acquisition ofHospital Corporation of America, 17 years after it was taken private for the first time in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout was the first of several to set new records for the largest buyout, eclipsing the 1989 buyout ofRJR Nabisco. It was later surpassed by the buyouts ofEQ OfficeandTXU.In August 2006, Bain was part of theconsortium, together withKohlberg Kravis Roberts,Silver Lake Partners, andAlpInvest Partners, that acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit ofPhilipsfor €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamedNXP Semiconductors. During the buyout boom, Bain was active in the acquisition of various retail businesses.In January 2006, Bain announced the acquisition ofBurlington Coat Factory, a discount retailer operating 367 department stores in 42 states, in a $2 billion buyout transaction.Six months later, in October 2006, Bain andThe Blackstone GroupacquiredMichaels Stores, the largest arts and crafts retailer in North America in a $6.0 billion leveraged buyout. Bain and Blackstone narrowly beat outKohlberg Kravis RobertsandTPG Capitalin an auction for the company.In June 2007, Bain agreed to acquireHD Supply, the wholesale construction supply business ofHome Depotfor $10.3 billion.Bain, along with partnersCarlyle GroupandClayton, Dubilier & Rice, would later negotiate a lower price ($8.5 billion) when the initial stages of thesubprime mortgage crisiscaused lenders to seek to renegotiate the terms of the acquisition financing.Just days after the announcement of the HD Supply deal, on June 27, Bain announced the acquisition ofGuitar Center, the leading musical equipment retailer in the U.S. Bain paid $1.9 billion, plus $200 million in assumed debt, representing a 26% premium to the stock's closing price prior to the announcement.Bain also acquiredEdcon Limited, which operates Edgars Department Stores inSouth AfricaandZimbabwefor 25 billion rand ($3.5 billion) in February 2007. Other investments during the buyout boom included:Bavaria Yachtbau, acquired for €1.3 billion in July 2007as well as Sensata Technologies, acquired fromTexas Instrumentsin 2006 for approximately $3 billion.It is noted that Bain Capital seldom engages in reinvesting in its own companies that ran into difficulties.This was the case withDade Behring, which was sold after emerging from a bankruptcy.

The revenue potential of this strategy, which may \"starve\" a company of capital,was increased by a 1970s court ruling that allowed companies to consider the entire fair market value of the company, instead of only their \"hard assets\", in determining how much money was available to pay dividends.In at least some instances, companies acquired by Bain borrowed money in order to increase their dividend payments, ultimately leading to the collapse of what had been financially stable businesses.",

SoftBank Corp.(ソフトバンク株式会社,SofutoBanku Kabushikigaisha)is SoftBank's telecommunications subsidiary, providing both mobile and fixed-line services. It was called SoftBank Mobile until July 2015, when the Group merged SoftBank BB Corp., SoftBank Telecom Corp. andYmobile Corporationto reflect its fixed-line and ISP operations. SoftBank's mobile communications arm began with the formation ofJapan Telecomin 1984. The Digital Phone Group (デジタルホン, DPG, three local companies) mobile phone division was formed in 1994, and J-PHONE Co., Ltd. (J-フォン) was formed in 1999 by the DGP/ Digital TU-KA Group merger (DTG, six local companies, not to be confused withTU-KA). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%. J-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker forPDC, SkyMelody ringtone download, theSha-Mailpicture mail introduced followingcamera phonesdeveloped bySHARP, the mobile multimedia data serviceJ-Skymodeled afterNTT DoCoMo'si-mode, and advancedJavaservices based onJSCL, modeled after NTT DoCoMo'sDoJabased i-appli. In October 2001, the British mobile phone groupVodafoneincreased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone.

While as of February 2005, DoCoMo'sFOMA3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone reduced investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match the needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers. By the end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen below 15M. During the same period, NTT DoCoMo gained 1.65 million customers, and KDDI/AU gained 1.82 million customers. Vodafone-Japan had only 4.8% of Japan's 3G market. Vodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky toVodafone live!and used J-Sky's principles, technologies, and business models to introduce theWAP-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By the end of October 2005, the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000. In March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface and lacked competitive features. On 17 March 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell Vodafone Japan to SoftBank for about US$15.1 billion. On 18 May 2006, the unit was renamed \"SoftBank Mobile Corp.\", effective 1 October 2006.

SoftBank's 3G network is compatible withUMTSand supports transparent global roaming for UMTS subscribers from other countries. Since May 2006, SoftBank's telecommunications marketing and commercials have principally revolved around \"Otosan\", the caninepatriarchof the otherwise human \"Shirato\" family.\"Otosan\" translates to father, and the character, aHokkaido dog, indeed acts as the father of the family, along with the son \"Kojiro\" (starred byDante Carver), mom \"Masako\" (Kanako Higuchi), and daughter \"Aya\" (Aya Ueto).The advertising series proved to be popular: CM Research Center ranked the Otousan adverts as the most popular in Japan between 2007 and 2012, based on monthly surveys of 3,000 randomly selected adults. SoftBank partnered with theIngressaugmented reality game, supporting the branded \"SoftBank Ultra Link\" in-gameitem. SoftBank bought a \"team\" for theAmerica's Cup.

With over $100 billion in capital, it is the world's largest technology-focusedinvestment fund.In 2019, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 was founded. The Softbank Vision Fund was created in May 2017 by theSoftBank Groupand thePublic Investment Fund(PIF).$100 billion was raised with PIF contributing $45 billion, SoftBank contributing $28 billion, theMubadala Investment Companycontributing $15 billion and the rest from other investors includingApple.Through Softbank Vision Fund,Masayoshi Sonexplained his intent to invest in all companies developing technologies in line with the globalartificial intelligencetrends, including various sectors such as finance or transportation.The project was internally codenamed \"Project Crystal Ball\". As of early February 2019, the Vision Fund had built up a 4.9% position inNvidiastock,and then was forced to sell all those shares when a prolonged plunge in Nvidia's stock price threatened to endanger the fund's overall performance.Over a six-month period, the fund had set up acollarstrategy around its Nvidia stock, thereby protecting itself from a severe price drop which began in October 2018 but also limiting its ability to profit from any rise in Nvidia's stock price.At the time, the Vision Fund recorded a $3.3 billion return on its Nvidia investment.The fund's February 2019 closeout of its Nvidia position preceded theAI boomand Nvidia's rapid transformation into one ofthe world's most valuable companies.By June 2024, the market value of those shares had exceeded $150 billion, causing Son to publicly remark that \"the fish that got away was big\". In January 2020, multiple Softbank-funded startups started cutting their staff, such as atGetaround,Oyo,Rappi,KaterraandZume.In February 2020,Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, bought a $2.5 billion stake in Softbank and pushed for restructuration and more transparency, especially regarding its Vision Fund.With many portfolio companies of the first fund not performing well and high profile debacles such as the buyout ofWeWorkafter its failedInitial public offering, investor confidence in the Vision Fund fell.In May 2020, Softbank announced the Vision Fund lost $18 billion leading to 15% of the fund's 500 staff being laid off.As a result, the Vision Fund 2 raised less than half of its $108 billion goal with all of it being funded by Softbank itself after failure to secure commitments from external investors. In May 2021, SoftBank announced the totalfair valueof both funds as of 31 March 2021 was $154 billion and the Vision Funds made a record profit of $36.99 billion due to its successful investment inCoupang.After announcing the success, SoftBank raised the size of Vision Fund 2 to $30 billion and stated it plans to continue self funding the second fund although it might consider trying again to secure funding from external investors.Also in May 2021, Bloomberg reported that Vision Fund could become public through a $300 millionSPACin 2021, listing inAmsterdam. In 2022, SoftBank Vision Fund posted a record 3.5 trillion yen loss ($27.4 billion) for its financial year ended on 31 March 2022 as the valuation of its stock portfolio plummeted.The fund's losing investments were massive and both Son, who had claimed he had a special ability to see the future ofdisruptiveentrepreneurship, and SoftBank, received much criticism from shareholders, peers and the business and finance media in general due to the magnitude of the failure. Costly failures like those ofKaterra,WirecardandZymergenwere just a few examples of SoftBank's reckless investing behaviour and the investing holding company's incompetence, neglect and failure to showdue diligence. In July 2022, CEORajeev Misraannounced he would be stepping back from some of his main roles including the management of SoftBank Vision Fund 2.Several other executives stepped down from their roles in the same year. In August 2022, the Vision fund announced a loss of $23.1 billion for the April–June quarter and that it would be planning to cut headcounts.Eric J. Savitz, associate editor for technology atBarron's, characterized the SoftBank Vision Fund as a failed experiment.Masayoshi Son said at the time he was \"embarrassed\" and \"ashamed\" when he was confronted with SoftBank Vision Fund'sdismal performance andThe Wall Street Journalcalled SoftBank a \"big loser\"whileBloombergelaborated on \"Masayoshi Son’s broken business model.\"Son's investing strategy in the first and second SoftBank Vision Funds established in 2017 and 2019, was being described as one reliant on thegreater fool theoryand the lackluster performance of its investments and Masayoshi Son's presentations in face of that, have been ridiculed by specialized media. By early 2023, having lost its exuberancedue to serious profitability issuesand facing decliningreturn on investmentprospectsas well as record losses,the once world's biggest investor in startups had invested just $300 million into startups in the last October–December quarter, down more than 90% from the previous year.In May 2023, the SoftBank Group disclosed that its Vision Fund lost a record $32 billion in the fiscal year ending in March 2023. In November 2024, Misra formally stepped down from his role in managing the Vision Fund and will be succeeded by Alex Clavel. SoftBank Vision Fund is managed by SoftBank Investment Advisers and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is managed by SoftBank Global Advisors.Both are subsidiaries of the SoftBank Group.The firm has an investment team that will evaluate and select companies for the funds to invest in.Investments made mostly are eitherventure capitalorprivate equitytype ones.

    "text": " HongShan Capital Group(HSG;Chinese:红杉中国;pinyin:Hóngshān Zhōngguó) is a globalventure capitalandprivate equityfirm founded in 2005. It was previously the China investment arm ofSequoia Capital(Sequoia) and was known as Sequoia Capital China and Sequoia China before it was rebranded andspun-offas a separate entity. HongShan has offices inHong Kong,Beijing,Shanghai,London,Singapore,Shenzhen, andTokyo. HongShan has expanded its focus over the years beyond early-stage investing to also cover growth stage, infrastructure, healthcare and consumer, and buyout funds. The firm manages around $56 billion in assets. In 2005,Neil Shenand Zhang Fan co-founded Sequoia Capital China with the guidance of Sequoia partnersMichael MoritzandDouglas Leone. The two were selected by Sequoia to lead the firm's venture in China. In 2009, Zhang resigned from Sequoia China for personal reasons leaving Shen to be entirely in charge of Sequoia China's operations. By that period, the firm had raised a combined $1 billion for three U.S. dollar-denominated China funds and 1 billion yuan for a local currency yuan-denominated investment fund. Afterwards Sequoia China raised more money, mostly from USinstitutional investorsand built a successful investment record which included companies such asAlibaba Group,JD.com,Meituan,Pinduoduo,SheinandByteDance. Historically 90% of returns came from consumer, consumer tech and healthcare fields. No other US investment manager had same level of success in China as Sequoia China. By 2023, Sequoia China had invested in over 1,000 projects. In 2021, the firm acquired a controlling stake in the French fashion brandAmi Paris. In June 2023, Sequoia announced that it would be splitting off Sequoia China as a separate entity and would be completed by 31 March 2024. This came at a time of rising tensions inChina–United States relationswhere Chinese leaders did not want to see US investors reaping rewards from their companies and US leaders did not want to see money being used to invest in Chinese technology such assemiconductors. However Sequoia denied that rising tensions were the reasons for the split. Sequoia China would be rebranded as HongShan (apinyinromanisationof its Chinese name, which means redwood) in English but its Chinese name remained the same. Going forward, the firm will be raising capital as a Chinese venture capital firm rather than as the Chinese arm of an American venture capital firm. In July 2023, HongShan announced that it had set up an office inSingaporeand was making plans to use it as a base to invest inSoutheast Asia. It was speculated  that it would be competing with Peak XV Partners, the Indian and Southeast Asian investment arm of Sequoia China that was also split off in June 2023. HongShan has stated there are no plans to open an office in the US. In October 2023, theUnited States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Partyasked Sequoia in a letter to provide details about investments inartificial intelligenceand other high-tech sectors made by it and HongShan. Members also questioned Sequoia if its decision to split-off HongShan would insulate some capital flows from US regulatory scrutiny. This was because HongShan relied onlimited partnersto finance deals so the split would not stop US institutional investors from continuing to invest in it. In addition, members also sated HongShan would be likely to scrap thenational securityscreening mechanism that Sequoia had created to evaluate investments by its companies. Members also accused HongShan of funnelling US capital into investments that contributed tohuman rights abusesand military modernisation with examples being DeepGlint and ByteDance. Additional requests included identifying any limited partners domiciled in China or that manage funds forstate-ownedor affiliated entities and to confirm the number of HongShan's limited partners that are US investors. So far US limited partners were not targeted and institutional investors that invest in Hongshan are confident they can continue their relationship with HongShan after theUnited States Department of the Treasuryfinalises restrictions on outbound investment mandated by anexecutive order. In November 2023, it was reported that despite scrutiny from US lawmakers, several new investors signed on with HongShan. They includeCalPERSandUniversity of WashingtonInvestment Management. Existing investors such asCPP Investment BoardandRegents of the University of Californiaadded additional commitments. In July 2024, HongShan raised its first new fund as a separate entity. It raised 18 billion RMB ($2.5 billion) for its new fund to invest in startups. In October 2024, HongShan set up a London office to look for investment opportunities in Europe with plans to make overseas investments. In November 2024, it was reported HongShan was struggling to deploy its large cash pile in a sluggish domestic market and tightening US controls. In 2025, HSG acquired a majority stake in the audio equipment makerMarshall Group.The deal, valued at $1.1 billion, became HSG's largest investment in Europe. HSG opened an office inTokyo,Japanin February 2025. In September 2025, HSG was shortlisted together withEQT,The Carlyle Group, andBoyu Capitalto bid for a controlling stake inStarbucks' China operations. In October 2025,Bayer AGwas reported to be selling its globalAveloxantibiotics business to HSG. In December 2025, HSG acquired a majority stake in Italian luxury fashion companyGolden Goose.",

    "text": " Social capitalis a concept used insociologyandeconomicsto define networks of relationships which are productive towards advancing the goals of individuals and groups.It involves the effective functioning ofsocial groupsthroughinterpersonal relationships, a shared sense ofidentity, a shared understanding, sharednorms, sharedvalues,trust,cooperation, andreciprocity. Some have described it as a form of capital that producespublic goodsfor acommon purpose, although this does not align with how it has been measured. Social capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived fromstrategic alliances, and the evolution ofcommunities. While it has been suggested that the termsocial capitalwas in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s,the earliest credited use is byLyda Hanifanin 1916 (see 20th century below). The debate of community versusmodernizationof society andindividualismhas been the most discussed topic among the founders ofsociology: such theorists asTönnies(1887),Durkheim(1893),Simmel(1905),Weber(1946)were convinced thatindustrialisationandurbanizationwere transforming social relationships in an irreversible way. They observed a breakdown of traditional bonds and the progressive development ofanomieandalienationin society. The power ofcommunity governancehas been stressed by many philosophers from antiquity to the 18th century, fromAristotletoThomas Aquinas, andEdmund Burke.This vision was strongly criticised at the end of the 18th century, with the development of the idea ofHomo Economicusand subsequently withrational choice theory. Such a set of theories became dominant in the last centuries, but many thinkers questioned the complicated relationship betweenmodern societyand the importance ofold institutions, in particular family and traditional communities. The concept that underlies social capital has a much longer history; thinkers exploring the relation between associational life and democracy were using similar concepts regularly by the 19th century, drawing on the work of earlier writers such asJames Madison(The Federalist Papers) andAlexis de Tocqueville(Democracy in America) to integrate concepts of social cohesion andconnectednessinto thepluralisttradition inAmerican political science.John Deweymay have made the first direct mainstream use ofsocial capitalinThe School and Societyin 1899, though he did not offer a definition. In the first half of the 19th century, de Tocqueville had observations about American life that seemed to outline and define social capital. He observed that Americans were prone to meeting at as many gatherings as possible to discuss all possible issues of state, economics, or the world that could be witnessed. The high levels of transparency caused greater participation from the people and thus allowed for democracy to work better. L. J. Hanifan's 1916 article regarding local support for rural schools is one of the first occurrences of the termsocial capitalin reference to social cohesion and personal investment in the community.In defining the concept, Hanifan contrasts social capital with material goods by defining it as: I do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit.… If he may come into contact with his neighbour, and they with other neighbours, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbours. Following the works ofTönnies(1887)andWeber(1946),reflection on social links in modern society continued with interesting contributions in the 1950s and in the 1960s. In particular,mass society theory– as developed byDaniel Bell(1962),Robert Nisbet(1969),Maurice R. Stein(1960),William H. Whyte(1956)– proposed themes similar to those of the founders, with a more pessimistic emphasis on the development of society. In the words of Stein (1960:1): \"The price for maintaining a society that encourages cultural differentiation and experimentation is unquestionably the acceptance of a certain amount of disorganization on both the individual and social level.\" Jane Jacobsused the term early in the 1960s. Although she did not explicitly define the termsocial capital, her usage referred to the value of networks.Political scientistRobert Salisbury advanced the term as a critical component of interest group formation in his 1969 article \"An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups\" in theMidwest Journal of Political Science. SociologistPierre Bourdieuused the term in 1972 in hisOutline of a Theory of Practice,and clarified the term some years later in contrast tocultural,economic, administrative capital,physical capital,political capital, social capital andsymbolic capital.SociologistsJames Coleman(1988),as well asBarry Wellman& Scot Wortley (1990),adoptedGlenn Loury's 1977 definition in developing and popularising the concept.In the late 1990s, the concept gained popularity, serving as the focus of aWorld Bankresearch programmeand the subject of several mainstream books, includingRobert Putnam'sBowling Alone,and Putnam &Lewis Feldstein'sBetter Together. All of these reflections contributed remarkably to the development of the social capital concept in the following decades. The appearance of the modern social capital conceptualization is a new way to look at this debate, keeping together the importance of community to build generalized trust and the same time, the importance of individual free choice, in order to create a more cohesive society. It is for this reason that social capital generated so much interest in the academic and political world. Social capital has multiple definitions, interpretations, and uses. David Halpern argues that the popularity of social capital forpolicymakersis linked to the concept's duality, coming because \"it has a hard nosed economic feel while restating the importance of the social.\" For researchers, the term is popular partly due to the broad range of outcomes it can explain;the multiplicity of uses for social capital has led to a multiplicity of definitions. Social capital has been used at various times to explain superior managerial performance,the growth of entrepreneurial firms,improved performance of functionally diverse groups,the value derived from strategic alliances,and enhanced supply-chain relations.\"A resource that actors derive from specific social structures and then use to pursue their interests; it is created by changes in the relationship among actors\" (Baker 1990, p. 619). Early attempts to define social capital focused on the degree to which social capital serves as a resource – be it for public good or private benefit.Robert D. Putnam(1993) suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast, others focus on the private benefits derived from the web of social relationships in which individual actors find themselves.This is reflected inNan Lin's concept of social capital as \"Investment in social relations with expected returns in the marketplace.\" This may subsume the concepts of some others such as Bourdieu, Flap and Eriksson.Newton (1997)treats social capital as a subjective phenomenon formed by values and attitudes that influence interactions. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), in their examination of the role of social capital in the creation ofintellectual capital, suggest that social capital should be considered in terms of three clusters: structural, relational, and cognitive. A number of scholars have raised concerns about the imprecision in defining social capital. Portes (2000), for example, notes that the term has become so widely used, including inmainstream media, that \"the point is approaching at which social capital comes to be applied to so many events and in so many different contexts as to lose any distinct meaning.\"The termcapitalis used byanalogywith other forms ofeconomic capital, as social capital is argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits. However, the analogy may be misleading in that, unlike financial forms of capital, social capital is not depleted by use;instead, it is depleted by non-use (use it or lose it). In this respect, it is similar to the economic concept ofhuman capital. Robison, Schmid, and Siles (2002) review various definitions of social capital and conclude that many do not satisfy the formal requirements of a definition.They assert that definitions must be of the form A=B, while many explanations of social capital describe what it can be used to achieve, where it resides, how it can be created, or what it can transform. In addition, they argue that many proposed definitions of social capital fail to satisfy the requirements of capital. They propose that social capital be defined assympathy: the object of another's sympathy has social capital; those who have sympathy for others provide social capital.This proposition appears to followAdam Smith,Theory of Moral Sentimentsto some degree, but Smith's conceptualization of sympathy (particularly in the first two chapters of this work) appear more concerned with the roles of acceptance or congruence – in ethics or virtue – in evaluating an individual's 'propriety of action'. Social capitalis different from the economic theory ofsocial capitalism, which challenges the idea thatsocialismandcapitalismare mutually exclusive. InThe Forms of Capital,Pierre Bourdieudistinguishes between three forms of capital:economic capital,cultural capitaland social capital.He definessocial capitalas \"the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.\"His treatment of the concept is instrumental, focusing on the advantages to possessors of social capital and the\"deliberate construction of sociability for the purpose of creating this resource.\"Quite contrary to Putnam's positive view of social capital, Bourdieu employs the concept to demonstrate a mechanism for the generational reproduction of inequality. Bourdieu thus points out that the wealthy and powerful use their \"old boys network\" or other social capital to maintain advantages for themselves, their social class, and their children. Thomas Sanderdefines it as \"the collectivevalueof allsocial networks(who people know), and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (normsofreciprocity).\"Social capital, in this view, emphasizes \"specificbenefitsthat flow from thetrust,reciprocity,information, andcooperationassociated with social networks.\" It \"creates value for the people who are connected, and forbystandersas well.\"Meanwhile, negative norms of reciprocity serve as disincentives for detrimental and violent behaviors. James Colemandefined social capital functionally as \"a variety of entities with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of actors...within the structure\"– that is, social capital is anything that facilitates individual orcollective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms.In Coleman's conception, social capital is a neutral resource that facilitates any manner of action, but whether society is better off as a result depends entirely on the individual uses to which it is put. According toRobert D. Putnam,social capitalrefers to \"connections among individuals – social networks and the norms ofreciprocityandtrustworthinessthat arise from them.\"In the view of Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintainingdemocracy. Putnam says that social capital is declining in the United States. This is seen in lower levels of trust in government and lower levels of civic participation. Putnam also suggests that a root cause of the decline in social capital iswomen's entry into the workforce, which could correlate with time restraints that inhibit civic organizational involvement likeparent-teacher associations.Technological transformation ofleisure(e.g., television) is another cause of declining social capital, as stated by Putnam. This offered a reference point from which several studies assessed social capital measurements by how media is engaged strategically to build social capital. In \"Social Capital, Civil Society, and Development\", political economistFrancis Fukuyamadefines social capital as generally understood rules that enable people to cooperate such as the norm ofreciprocityorreligious doctrinelikeChristianity. Social capital is formed by repeated interactions over time and, he argues, is critical for development and difficult to generate through public policy. The importance of social capital for economic development is that these norms of behavior reducetransaction costof exchange such as legal contracts and government regulations. Fukuyama suggests that while social capital is beneficial for development, it also imposes cost on non-group members with unintended consequences for general welfare. ReferencingAlexis de TocquevilleinDemocracy in America,and what he described as theart of associationof the American propensity forcivil association, Fukuyama argues social capital is what produces acivil society. While civic engagement is an important part of democracy and development, Fukuyama states that, \"one person's civic engagement is another'srent-seeking.\" Therefore, while social capital can facilitate economic development by reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity, social capital can also distort democracy if civic association enables special interest to gain special favors. However, Fukuyama argues despite the risk of society having too much social capital, it is nonetheless worse to have too little and be unable to organize for public goods and welfare enhancing activity. Carlos García Timóndescribes that the structural dimensions of social capital relate to an individual ability to make weak and strong ties to others within a system. This dimension focuses on the advantages derived from the configuration of an actor's, either individual or collective, network.The differences betweenweakandstrongties are explained by Granovetter (1973).Bridging social capital refers to the weak ties that individuals with heterogeneous limited interactions form. Bridging social capital is more likely to provide valuable new information (Moshkovitz and Hayat, 2021). Some others describes the weak and strong ties relationship as bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital refers to strong ties: the intimate relationships people feel close to and trust. The relational dimension focuses on the character of the connection between individuals. This is best characterized through trust of others and their cooperation and the identification an individual has within a network.Hazleton and Kennan (2000)added a third angle, that of communication. Communication is needed to access and use social capital through exchanging information, identifying problems and solutions, and managing conflict. According toBoisot(1995),and Boland & Tenkasi (1995),meaningful communication requires at least some sharing context between the parties to such exchange. The cognitive dimension focuses on the shared meaning, representations and interpretations that individuals or groups have with one another. Whereas some scholars, most prominentlyRobert D. Putnam, posit that social capital has positive ends,a sizable body of literature finds that social capital can have adverse effects. Research bySheri Bermanand Dylan Riley, as well as economists Shanker Satyanath, Nico Voigtländer, and Hans-Joachim Voth, have linked civic associations to the rise of fascist movements.Pierre Bourdieu's work tends to show how social capital can be used practically to produce or reproduce inequality, demonstrating for instance how people gain access to powerful positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections. An example of the complexities of the negative of effects social capital is violence or criminalgangactivity that is encouraged through the strengthening of intra-group relationships (bonding social capital).The negative consequences of social capital are more often associated withbondingvis-à-visbridging. Without \"bridging\" social capital, \"bonding\" groups can become isolated anddisenfranchisedfrom the rest of society and, most importantly, from groups with which bridging must occur in order to denote an \"increase\" in social capital. Bonding social capital is a necessary antecedent for the development of the more powerful form of bridging social capital.Bonding and bridging social capital can work together productively if in balance, or they may work against each other. As social capital bonds and stronger homogeneous groups form, the likelihood of bridging social capital is attenuated. Bonding social capital can also perpetuate sentiments of a certain group, allowing for the bonding of certain individuals together upon a common radical ideal. The strengthening of insular ties can lead to a variety of effects such as ethnic marginalization or social isolation. In extreme cases ethnic cleansing may result if the relationship between different groups is so strongly negative. In mild cases, it  isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the bonding social capital and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital. Edwards and Foley, as editors of a special edition of theAmerican Behavioral Scientiston \"Social Capital, Civil Society and Contemporary Democracy\", raised two key issues in the study of social capital. First, social capital is not equally available to all, in much the same way that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic andsocial isolationlimit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society. On top of this, Portes (1998) has identified four negative consequences of social capital: Social capital (in the institutionalRobert Putnamsense) may also lead to bad outcomes if thepolitical institutionanddemocracyin a specific country is not strong enough and is therefore overpowered by the social capital groups. \"Civil society and the collapse of theWeimar Republic\" suggests that \"it was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem during theWihelmineand Weimar eras.\"Because the political institutions were so weak people looked to other outlets. \"Germans threw themselves into their clubs, voluntary associations, and professional organizations out of frustration with the failures of the national government and political parties, thereby helping to undermine the Weimar Republic and facilitateHitler's rise to power.\" In this article about the fall of theWeimar Republic, the author makes the claim that Hitler rose to power so quickly because he was able to mobilize the groups towards one common goal. Even though German society was, at the time, a \"joining\" society these groups were fragmented and their members did not use the skills they learned in their club associations to better their society, but to encourage their values across all cultures to provide a better society for people. They were very introverted in the Weimar Republic. Hitler was able to capitalize on this by uniting these highly bonded groups under the common cause of bringing Germany to the top of world politics. The former world order had been destroyed duringWorld War I, and Hitler believed that Germany had the right and the will to become a dominant global power. Additionally, in his essay \"A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital\",Michael Shindler expands upon Berman's argument that Weimar social clubs and similar associations in countries that did not develop democracy, were organized in such a way that they fostered a \"we\" instead of an \"I\" mentality among their members, by arguing that groups which possess cultures that stress solidarity over individuality, even ones that are \"horizontally\" structured and which were also common to pre-SovietEastern Europe, will not engender democracy if they are politically aligned with non-democratic ideologies. Using a network-based conception for characterizing the social capital of collectivities (such as organizations or business clusters),Lester, Maheshwari, and McLain (2013) note that negative social capital may be the cause for disadvantageous differences among minority firms versus majority firms. While studying norms amongAfrican-Americanfamily firms andEuro-Americanfamily firms, Lester et al. noted that negative social capital was created when the owner of the company was pressured to engage in social behavior not conducive to firm profits. Robert Putnam, in his later work, also suggests that social capital, and the associated growth ofpublic trustare inhibited by immigration and rising racialdiversityin communities.Putnam's study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a lack of homogeneity, some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (US) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high (Eastern Europe), it was found that citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be.  Lack of homogeneity led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital. Varshney (2001) studied the correlation between the presence of interethnic networks (bridging) versus intra-ethnic ones (bonding) onethnic violenceinIndia.He argues that interethnic networks are agents of peace because they build bridges and manage tensions, by noting that if communities are organized only along intra-ethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak or even nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely.\nThree main implications of intercommunal ties explain their worth: This is a useful distinction; nevertheless, its implication on social capital can only be accepted if one espouses thefunctionalistunderstanding of the latter concept. Indeed, it can be argued that interethnic, as well as intra-ethnic networks can serve various purposes, either increasing or diminishing social capital. In fact, Varshney himself notes that intra-ethnic policing (equivalent to the \"self-policing\"mechanism proposed by Fearon and Laitin, 1996)may lead to the same result as interethnic engagement. James Coleman(1988) has indicated that social capital eventually led to the creation ofhuman capitalfor the future generation.Human capital, a private resource, could be accessed through what the previous generation accumulated through social capital. John Field (2003) suggested that such a process could lead to the very inequality social capital attempts to resolve.While Coleman viewed social capital as a relatively neutral resource, he did not deny the class reproduction that could result from accessing such capital, given that individuals worked toward their own benefit. Even though Coleman never truly addressesPierre Bourdieuin his discussion, this coincides with Bourdieu's argument set forth inReproduction in Education, Society and Culture. Bourdieu and Coleman were fundamentally different at the theoretical level (as Bourdieu believed the actions of individuals were rarely ever conscious, but more so only a result of theirhabitusbeing enacted within a particular field, but this realization by both seems to undeniably connect their understanding of the more latent aspects of social capital. According to Bourdieu,habitusrefers to the social context within which a social actor is socialized. Thus, it is the social platform, itself, that equips one with the social reality they become accustomed to. Out of habitus comes field, the manner in which one integrates and displays their habitus. To this end, it is the social exchange and interaction between two or moresocial actors. To illustrate this, we assume that an individual wishes to better his place in society. He therefore accumulates social capital by involving himself in a social network, adhering to the norms of that group, allowing him to later access the resources (e.g. social relationships) gained over time. If, in the case of education, he uses these resources to better his educational outcomes, thereby enabling him to becomesocially mobile, he effectively has worked to reiterate and reproduce the stratification of society, as social capital has done little to alleviate the system as a whole. This may be one negative aspect of social capital, but seems to be an inevitable one in and of itself, as are all forms of capital. Compared to Bourdieu,Robert D. Putnamhas used the concept in a much more positive light: though he was at first careful to argue that social capital was a neutral term, stating \"whether or not [the] shared are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter,\"his work on American society tends to frame social capital as a producer of \"civic engagement\" and also a broad societal measure of communal health.He also transforms social capital from a resource possessed by individuals to an attribute of collectives, focusing on norms and trust as producers of social capital to the exclusion of networks. Mahyar Arefi (2003) identifies consensus-building as a direct positive indicator of social capital.Consensus implies \"shared interest\" and agreement among various actors and stakeholders to induce collective action.Collective actionis thus an indicator of increased social capital. InBowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community(2000), Harvard political scientistRobert D. Putnamwrites: Henry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America – though it will be – but because it will be good for us. Putnam speaks of two main components of the concept, the creation of which Putnam credits to Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal: Typical examples are that criminal gangs create bonding social capital, whilechoirsand bowling clubs (hence the title, as Putnam lamented their decline) create bridging social capital.The distinction is useful in highlighting how social capital may not always be beneficial for society as a whole (though it is always an asset for those individuals and groups involved). Horizontal networks of individual citizens and groups that enhance community productivity and cohesion are said to be positive social capital assets whereas self-serving exclusive gangs and hierarchical patronage systems that operate at cross purposes tosocietalinterests can be thought of as negative social capital burdens on society. Similar to Putnam,Daniel P. Aldrichdescribes three mechanisms of social capital: Aldrich also applies the ideas of social capital to the fundamental principles ofdisaster recovery, and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. In his bookBuilding Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery, he primarily examines Japanese recovery following the2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Social capital development on the internet via social networking websites such asFacebookorMyspacetends to be bridging capital according to one study, though \"virtual\" social capital is a new area of research. There are two other sub-sources of social capital: Consummatory capital a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. Two examples of consummatory social capital are value interjection and solidarity. Value interjection:refers to the behavior of individuals or groups adhering tosocietal normsby meeting expected obligations, such as following established rules, timely bill payments, and punctuality. Diligent adherence contributes personal advantages like financial stability and improved relationships, as well as broader societal gains, including enhanced market confidence and perceived reliability. Coleman goes on to say that when people live in this way and benefit from this type of social capital, individuals in the society are able to rest assured that their belongings and family will be safe.This understanding ofsolidaritymay be traced to 19th centurysocialistthinkers, whose main focus was the urban working class of theIndustrial Revolution. They analyzed the reasons these workers supported each other for the benefit of the group and held that this support was an adaptation to the immediate social environment, as opposed to a trait that had been taught to the workers in their youth.As another example, Coleman states that possessing this type of social capital individuals to stand up for what they believe in, and even die for it, in the face of adversity. While the notion ofsolidarity as social capitalis sometimes attributed toKarl Marx, in particular, the termsocial capitalhad a quite different meaning for Marx. All forms of \"capital\" were, for Marx, possessed only by capitalists and he emphasized the basis of labour in capitalist society, as a class constituted by individuals obliged to sell theirlabour power, because they lacked sufficient capital, in any sense of the word, to do otherwise. Marx saw \"social capital\" as a theoretical total amount of capital, purely in the sense of accumulated wealth or property, that existed in a particular society. He thereby contrasted it with specific and discrete \"individual capital.\" Instrumental capital is behavior that is taught through one's surroundings over time. Individuals donating their resources are not seeking direct repayment from the recipient, but motivated by membership in the same social structure. Donors might not see a direct repayment, but, most commonly, they will be held by the society in greater honor. Portes mentions the donation of a scholarship to a member of the same ethnic group as an example of this. The donor is not giving up resources to be directly repaid by the recipient, but, as stated above, the honor of the community. With this in mind, recipients might not know the benefactor personally, but prospers as a member of the same social group. Social capital is also linked with religious communities. Religion represents an important aspect of social capital (religious social capital).However, Putnam found that membership in secular organizations in the United States had a greater association withvolunteering,blood donations,charity, andphilanthropythan membership in religious organizations, that membership in secular organizations was associated with participation incommunity projectswhile membership in religious organizations was not, and that the difference was mostly attributable due to community and organizational involvement byreligious fundamentalistsbeing confined to activities within their congregations rather than the wider communities in which the congregations are located. There is no widely held consensus on how to measure social capital, which has become a debate in itself.While usually one can intuitively sense the level/amount of social capital present in a given relationship (regardless of type or scale),quantitative measuringhas proven somewhat complicated, resulting in different metrics for different functions. SociologistsCarl L. BankstonandMin Zhouhave argued that one of the reasons social capital is so difficult to measure is that it is neither an individual-level nor a group-level phenomenon, but one that emerges acrosslevels of analysisas individuals participate in groups. They argue that the metaphor of \"capital\" may be misleading because, unlikefinancial capital, which is a resource held by an individual, the benefits of forms ofsocial organizationare not held by actors, but are results of the participation of actors in advantageously organized groups. One type of quantitative social capital measure uses name generators to construct social networks and to measure the level of social capital.These networks are constructed by asking participants to name people that they interact with, such as \"Name all the people you've discussed important matters with in the past six months.\"Name generators are often useful to construct core discussion networks of close ties, rather than weaker ties. Many studies measure social capital by asking the question: \"do you trust the others?\" Other researches analyse the participation in voluntary associations or civic activities. To expand upon themethodologicalpotential of measuringonline and offlinesocial bonding, as it relates to social capital, Williams (2006), offers a matrix of social capital measures that distinguishes social bridging as a form of less emotionally-tethered relationships compared to bonding. Bonding and bridging sub-scales are proposed, which have been adopted by over 300 scholarly articles. Lin, Peng, Kim, Kim & LaRose (2012) offer a noteworthy application of the scale by measuring international residents originating from locations outside of the United States. The study found that social media platforms likeFacebookprovide an opportunity for increased social capital, but mostly for extroverts. However, less introverted social media users could engage social media and build social capital by connecting with Americans before arriving and then maintaining old relationships from home upon arriving to the states. The ultimate outcome of the study indicates that social capital is measurable and is a concept that may beoperationalizedto understand strategies for coping withcross-culturalimmersion through online engagement. The level ofcohesionof a group also affects its social capital and vice versa.However, there is no one quantitative way of determining the level of cohesiveness, but rather a collection of social network models that researchers have used over the decades to operationalize social capital. One of the dominant methods is Ronald Burt's constraint measure, which taps into the role of tie strength and group cohesion. Another network-based model is network transitivity. Knack and Keefer (1996) measuredeconometriccorrelations between confidence and civic cooperation norms, witheconomic growthin a large group of countries. They found that confidence and civic cooperation have a great impact in economic growth, and that in lesspolarizedsocieties in terms of inequality and ethnic differences, social capital is bigger. Narayan and Pritchet (1997) researched theassociativitydegree and economic performance in rural homes ofTanzania. They observed that even inhigh poverty indexes, families with higher levels of incomes had more participation in collective organizations. The social capital they accumulated because of this participation had individual benefits for them, and created collective benefits through different routes, for example: their agricultural practices were better than those of the families without participation (they had more information about agrochemicals, fertilizers and seeds); they had more information about the market; they were prepared to take more risks, because being part of a social network made them feel more protected; they had an influence on the improvement of public services, showing a bigger level of participation in schools; they cooperated more in the municipality level. In measuring political social capital, it is common to take the sum of society's membership of its groups. Groups with higher membership (such aspolitical parties) contribute more to the amount of capital than groups with lower membership, although many groups with low membership (such as communities) still add up to be significant.  While it may seem that this is limited by population, this need not be the case as people join multiple groups. In a study done byYankee City,a community of 17,000 people was found to have over 22,000 different groups. How a group relates to the rest of society also affects social capital, but in a different manner. Strong internal ties can in some cases weaken the group's perceived capital in the eyes of the general public, as in cases where the group is geared towards crime, distrust, intolerance, violence or hatred towards others. TheKu Klux Klanis an example of this kind of organizations. Foschi and Lauriola have presented a measure ofsociabilityas a proxy of social capital. The authors demonstrated that facets of sociability can mediate between general personality traits and measures of civic involvement andpolitical participation, as predictors of social capital, in aholisticmodel ofpolitical behavior. TheWorld Social Capital Monitoris an instrument for measuringsocial goodsand social capital created by theUnited Nations Sustainable Development Groupin partnership with civil society actors. The project identifies social values such astrust,solidarity,helpfulness,friendliness,hospitalityand the willingness to finance public goods with the help of anonymoussurveys. The surveys started in 2016. While influential, some have identified areas of concern or improvement within the work ofRobert D. Putnam. This includes: Robison and colleagues (2012) measured the relative importance of selfishness and four social capital motives using resource allocation data collected in hypothetical surveys and non-hypothetical experiments. Theselfishness motiveassumes that an agent's allocation of a scarce resource is independent of his relationships with others. This motive is sometimes referred to as theselfishness of preference assumptioninneoclassical economics. Social capital motivesassume that agents' allocation of a scarce resource may be influenced by their social capital or sympathetic relationships with others which may produce socio-emotional goods that satisfy socio-emotional needs for validation and belonging: Various authors give definitions ofcivil societythat refer to voluntary associations and organisations outside the market and state.This definition is very close to that of thethird sector, which consists of \"private organisations that are formed and sustained by groups of people acting voluntarily and without seeking personal profit to provide benefits for themselves or for others.\" According to such authors as Walzer (1992), Alessandrini (2002),Newtown, Stolle & Rochon, Foley & Edwards (1997),and Walters, it is through civil society, or more accurately, thethird sector, that individuals are able to establish and maintain relational networks. Thesevoluntary associationsalso connect people with each other, build trust and reciprocity through informal, loosely structured associations, and consolidate society through altruism without obligation. It is \"this range of activities, services and associations produced by... civil society\" that constitutes the sources of social capital. Not only has civil society been documented to produce sources of social capital, according to Lyons'Third Sector(2001),social capital does not appear in any guise under either the factors that enable or those that stimulate the growth of the third sector. Likewise, Onyx (2000) describes how social capital depends on an already functioning community.The idea that creating social capital (i.e., creating networks) will strengthen civil society underlies current Australian social policy aimed at bridging deepening social divisions. The goal is to reintegrate those marginalised from the rewards of the economic system into \"the community.\" However, according to Onyx (2000), while the explicit aim of this policy is inclusion, its effects are exclusionary. Foley and Edwards (1997) believe that \"political systems...are important determinants of both the character of civil society and of the uses to which whatever social capital exists might be put.\"Alessandrini agrees, saying that, \"in Australia in particular,neo-liberalismhas been recast aseconomic rationalismand identified by several theorists and commentators as a danger to society at large because of the use to which they are putting social capital to work.\" The resurgence of interest in social capital as a remedy for the cause of today's social problems draws directly on the assumption that these problems lie in the weakening of civil society. However this ignores the arguments of many theorists who believe that social capital leads to exclusion rather than to a stronger civil society.Ininternational development,Ben Fine(2001) andJohn Harriss(2001) have been heavily critical of the inappropriate adoption of social capital as a supposed panacea (promoting civil society organisations and NGOs, for example, as agents of development) for the inequalities generated by neoliberal economic development.This leads to controversy as to the role of state institutions in the promotion of social capital.\nAn abundance of social capital is seen as being almost a necessary condition for modernliberal democracy. A low level of social capital leads to an excessively rigid and unresponsive political system and high levels of corruption, in the political system and in the region as a whole. Formal public institutions require social capital in order to function properly, and while it is possible to have too much social capital (resulting in rapid changes and excessive regulation), it is decidedly worse to have too little. Post-Communist: Kathleen Dowley and Brian Silver published an article entitled \"Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States\", in which they find that inpost-communist states, higher levels of social capital did not equate to higher levels of democracy. However, higher levels of social capital led to higher support for democracy. Third-world: A number of intellectuals indeveloping countrieshave argued that the idea of social capital, particularly when connected to certain ideas about civil society, is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor andNGO-drivenimperialismand that it functions, primarily, to blame the poor for their condition. Chinese: The concept of social capital in a Chinesesocial contexthas been closely linked with the concept ofguanxi. American: One attempt to measure social capital, involving the quantity, quality and strength of an individual social capital, was spearheaded by Corporate Alliance in the English-speaking market segment of the US,and Xentrum through the Latin American Chamber of Commerce in Utah on the Spanish-speaking population of the same country.With the assistance of software applications and web-based relationship-oriented systems such asLinkedIn, these kinds of organizations are expected to provide its members with a way to keep track of thenumberof their relationships, meetings designed to boost thestrengthof each relationship using group dynamics, executive retreats and networking events as well as training in how to reach out to higher circles ofinfluentialpeople. There are many factors that drive volume towards theballot box, including education, employment, civil skills, and time. Careful evaluation of these fundamental factors often suggests that women do not vote at similar levels as men. However the gap between women and menvoter turnoutis diminishing and in some cases women are becoming more prevalent at the ballot box than their male counterparts. Recent research on social capital is now serving as an explanation for this change. Social capital offers a wealth of resources and networks that facilitate political engagement. Since social capital is readily available no matter the type of community, it is able to override more traditional queues for political engagement; e.g.: education, employment, civil skills, etc. There are unique ways in which women organize. These differences from men make social capital more personable and impressionable to women audiences thus creating a stronger presence in regards to political engagement. A few examples of these characteristics are: The often informal nature of female social capital allows women to politicizeapoliticalenvironments without conforming to masculine standards, thus keeping this activity at a low public profile. These differences are hard to recognize within the discourse of political engagement and may explain why social capital has not been considered as a tool for female political engagement until as of late. A growing body of research has found that the presence of social capital through social networks and communities has a protective quality on health. Social capital affects health risk behavior in the sense that individuals who are embedded in a network or community rich in support, social trust, information, and norms, have resources that help achieve health goals.For example, a person who is sick with cancer may receive the information, money, or moral support needed to endure treatment and recover. Social capital also encourages social trust and membership. These factors can discourage individuals from engaging in risky health behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking. Furthermore, neighbourhood social capital may also aid in buffering health inequities amongst children and adolescents.Social capital indicators such as neighbourhood cohesion,social support, and ties providing a bond between members of the same religion, have been found to be associated with better health despite financial or socioeconomic hardship.The function of social capital as a health buffer in circumstances of social disadvantage has also received attention in research on the health of minority ethnic populations. The relationships and networks that are maintained by an ethnic minority population in a geographical area where a high percentage of residents belong to the same ethnic group may lead to better health outcomes than would be expected based on other individual and neighbourhood characteristics. Such effects have been investigated in England,New Zealand,and the United States. Inversely, a lack of social capital can impair health. For example, results from a survey given to 13- to 18-year-old students in Sweden showed that low social capital and low social trust are associated with higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and depression.Additionally, negative social capital can detract from health. Although there are only a few studies that assess social capital in criminalized populations, there is information that suggests that social capital does have a negative effect in broken communities. Deviant behavior is encouraged by deviant peers via favorable definitions and learning opportunities provided by network-based norms.However, in these same communities, an adjustment of norms (i.e. deviant peers being replaced by positive role models) can pose a positive effect.\nResearchers have also investigated the hypothesis that the health benefits of social capital depend on the socioeconomic resources an individual or community has available to them. For example, social capital may boost health only for those with higher levels of education, or more so for those with a higher rather than a lower income.This research is based on Bourdieu's notion that social, economic, and cultural capital are dependent on each other. Similar to watching the news and keeping abreast of current events, the use of the Internet can relate to an individual's level of social capital. In one study, informational uses of the Internet correlated positively with an individual's production of social capital, and social-recreational uses were negatively correlated (higher levels of these uses correlated with lower levels of social capital).An example supporting the former argument is the contribution of Peter Maranci's blog (Charlie on the Commuter Line) to address the train problems in Massachusetts. He created it after an incident where a lady passed out during a train ride due to the congestion in the train and help was delayed because of the congestion in the train and the inefficiency of the train conductor. His blog exposed the poor conditions of train stations, overcrowding train rides and inefficiency of the train conductor which eventually influenced changes within the transit system. Another perspective holds that the rapid growth of social networking sites such asFacebookandMyspacesuggests that individuals are creating a virtual-network consisting of both bonding and bridging social capital. Unlike face to face interaction, people can instantly connect with others in a targeted fashion by placing specific parameters with Internet use. This means that individuals can selectively connect with others based on ascertained interests, and backgrounds. Facebook is currently the most popular social networking site and touts many advantages to its users including serving as asocial lubricantfor individuals who otherwise have difficulties forming and maintaining both strong and weak ties with others. This argument continues, although the preponderance of evidence shows a positive association between social capital and the Internet. Critics of virtual communities believe that the Internet replaces our strong bonds with online \"weak-ties\"or with socially empty interactions with the technology itself.Others fear that the Internet can create a world of \"narcissismof similarity,\" where sociability is reduced to interactions between those that are similar in terms of ideology, race, or gender.A few articles suggest that technologically based interactions has a negative relationship with social capital by displacing time spent engaging in geographical/ in-person social activities.However, the consensus of research shows that the more time people spend online the more in-person contact they have, thus positively enhancing social capital. Recent research, conducted in 2006, also shows that Internet users often have wider networks than those who access the Internet irregularly or not at all. When not considering family and work contacts, Internet users actually tend to have contact with a higher number of friends and relatives.This is supported by another study that shows that Internet users and non-Internet users do feel equally close to the same number of people; also the Internet users maintain relationships with 20% more people whom they \"feel somewhat close\" to. Other research shows that younger people use the Internet as a supplemental medium for communication, rather than letting the Internet communication replace face-to-face contact.This supports the view that Internet communication does not hinder development of social capital and does not make people feel lonelier than before. Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe (2007) suggest social capital exercised online is a result of relationships formed offline; whereby, bridging capital is enabled through a \"maintenance\" of relationships. Among respondents of this study, social capital built exclusively online creates weaker ties.A distinction of social bonding is offered by Ellison et al., 2007, suggesting bonds, or strong ties, are possible through social media, but less likely. Conversely, in the afterword to the second edition ofBowling Alone(2020), political scientistRobert D. Putnamfound that the expansion ofinternet access,social media,social networking services,online dating services,professional networking services, ande-commercewas probably accelerating the decline in social capital among the U.S. population that began in the 1960s, while mostly just reinforcing existing social connections rather than creating new ones (i.e. bonding social capital versus bridging social capital)—analogously to the effect that theexpansion of telephone ownership by U.S. householdshad (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1890 to a majority by 1946 and to 75 percent by 1957). In the first edition ofBowling Alone(2000), Putnam found that the social capital decline was caused primarily by theexpansion of television ownershipby U.S. households (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1948 to 75 percent by 1955), the gradual replacement of theGreatest GenerationandSilent Generationbirth yearcohortsby theBaby boomerandGeneration Xbirth year cohorts, and the effect of the television ownership expansion on Baby boomers and Generation X.Putnam anticipated that if internet use resembled television and telephone use that the impact of the internet on social capital would largely be the same as the television and the telephone, but Putnam rejectedtechnological determinismin suggesting that the impacts of the internet on social capital was not inevitable and would depend on how Americans collectively chose to use the internet.With respect to political and civic engagement specifically, Putnam referenced meta-analyses and other research in political science in the second edition ofBowling Alonethat concluded that the effects of social networking services and social media on political and civic participation was minimal or negative. When considered with the use of social media forpassive observationoronline-only and low-effort supportof political and social movements, Putnam concluded that the relationship betweeninternet activismand offlineactivismiscorrelational rather than causalin light of research about pre-internet political and social movements (such as thecivil rights movementandopposition to the Vietnam Warin the United States and the 1989Peaceful RevolutioninEast Germany) showing that personal connections with other activists are a stronger predictor of which individuals remain part of a movement rather than ideological commitment.Instead, Putnam argued that the weight of the research showed that social media has exacerbatedpolitical polarization in the United Statesdue to ideological and socioeconomichomophilyamongusersocial networks andsocial media algorithmsthat promoteecho chambers,virtue signalling, anddisinformation.However, Putnam also suggested that these effects of social media owed to thesurveillance capitalismbusiness models of the companies that operated the services rather than the technology itself, which created incentives for the companies to promoteconsumerismrather than building social capital andsocial trust. Coleman and Hoffer collectedquantitative dataof 28,000 students in total 1,015 public, Catholic and other private high schools in America from the 7 years' period from 1980 to 1987.It was found from thislongitudinal researchthat social capital in students' families and communities attributed to the much lower dropout rates inCatholic schoolscompared with the higher rates in public. Teachman et al. (1996) further develop the family structure indicator suggested by Coleman. They criticise Coleman, who used only the number of parents present in the family, neglected the unseen effect of more discrete dimensions such as stepparents' and different types of single-parent families. They take into account of a detailed counting of family structure, not only with two biological parents or stepparent families, but also with types of single-parent families with each other (mother-only, father-only, never-married, and other). They also contribute to the literature by measuring parent-child interaction by the indicators of how often parents and children discuss school-related activities. Morgan and Sorensen (1999) directly challenge Coleman for his lacking of an explicit mechanism to explain why Catholic schools students perform better than public school students on standardised tests of achievement.Researching students in Catholic schools and public schools again, they propose two comparable models of social capital effect on mathematic learning.  One is on Catholic schools as norm-enforcing schools whereas another is on public schools as horizon-expanding schools. It is found that while social capital can bring about positive effect of maintaining an encompassing functional community in norm-enforcing schools, it also brings about the negative consequence of excessive monitoring. Creativity and exceptional achievement would be repressed as a result. Whereas in horizon expanding school, social closure is found to be negative for student's mathematic achievement. These schools explore a different type of social capital, such as information about opportunities in the extended social networks of parents and other adults.  The consequence is that more learning is fostered than norm-enforcing Catholic school students. In sum, Morgan and Sorensen study implies that social capital is contextualised, one kind of social capital may be positive in this setting but is not necessarily still positive in another setting. In the setting of education through Kilpatrick, Johns, and Mulford (2010) state that \"social capital is a useful lens for analysinglifelong learningand its relationship to community development.\"Social capital is particularly important in terms of education. Also the importance of education with \"schools being designed to create 'functioning community' - forging tighter links between parents and the school\" linking that without this interaction, the social capital in this area is disadvantaged and demonstrates that social capital plays a major role in education. Putnam (2000) mentions in his bookBowling Alone, \"Child developmentis powerfully shaped by social capital\" and continues \"presence of social capital has been linked to various positive outcomes, particularly in education.\"According to his book, these positive outcomes are the result of parents' social capital in a community. In states where there is a high social capital, there is also a high education performance.The similarity of these states is that parents were more associated with their children's education. Teachers have reported that when the parents participate more in their children's education and school life, it lowers levels of misbehavior, such as bringing weapons to school, engaging in physical violence, unauthorized absence, and being generally apathetic about education.Borrowing Coleman's quotation from Putnam's book, Coleman once mentioned we cannot understate \"the importance of the embeddedness of young persons in the enclaves of adults most proximate to them, first and most prominent the family and second, a surrounding community of adults.\" Without social capital in the area of education, teachers and parents who play a responsibility in a students learning, the significant impacts on their child's academic learning can rely on these factors. With focus on parents contributing to their child's academic progress as well as being influenced by social capital in education. Without the contribution by the parent in their child's education, gives parents less opportunity and participation in the student's life. As Tedin and Weiher (2010)state, \"one of the most important factors in promoting student success is the active involvement of parents in a child's education.\" With parents also involved in activities and meetings the school conducts, the more involved parents are with other parents and the staff members. Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community. Sampson et al. (1999) stress thenormativeor goal-directed dimension of social capital,claiming that \"resources or networks alone (e.g. voluntary associations, friendship ties, organisational density) are neutral---they may or may not be effective mechanism for achieving intended effect.\" Marjoribanks and Kwok (1998) conducted a survey inHong Kongsecondary schools with 387 fourteen-year-old students with an aim to analyse female and male adolescents differential educational achievement by using social capital as the main analytic tool. In that research, social capital is approved of its different effects upon different genders. In his thesis \"New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance\", Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) argues that adaptation is a process of activation and accumulation of (cultural and social) capitals. The research findings show that supportive networks is the key determinant differentiating the divergent adaptation pathways. Supportive networks, as a form of social capital, is necessary for activating the cultural capital the newly arrived students possessed. The amount of accumulated capital is also relevant to further advancement in the ongoing adaptation process. Min ZhouandCarl L. Bankston(1998), in their study of aVietnamesecommunity inNew Orleans, found that preserving traditional ethnic values enableimmigrantsto integrate socially and to maintainsolidarityin an ethnic community.Ethnic solidarity is especially important in the context where immigrants just arrive in the host society.In her article \"Social Capital in Chinatown\", Zhou examines how the process of adaptation of youngChinese Americansis affected by tangible forms of social relations between the community, immigrant families, and the younger generations.Chinatown serves as the basis of social capital that facilitates the accommodation of immigrant children in the expected directions. Ethnic support provides impetus to academic success.  Furthermore, maintenance of literacy in native language also provides a form of social capital that contributes positively to academic achievement. Stanton-Salazar and Dornbuschfound that bilingual students were more likely to obtain the necessary forms of institutional support to advance their school performance and their life chances. In order to understand social capital as a subject ingeography, one must look at it in a sense of space, place, and territory. In its relationship, the tenetsof geography relate to the ideas of social capital in the family, community, and in the use of social networks. The biggest advocate for seeing social capital as a geographical subject was American economist and political scientistRobert Putnam. His main argument for classifying social capital as a geographical concept is that the relationships of people is shaped and molded by the areas in which they live. There are many areas in which social capital can be defined by the theories and practices. In 1984,Anthony Giddensdeveloped a theory in which he relates social structures and the actions that they produce. In his studies, he does not look at the individual participants of these structures, but how the structures and the social connections that stem from them are diffused over space.If this is the case, the continuous change in social structures could bring about a change in social capital, which can cause changes in community atmosphere. If an area is plagued by social organizations whose goals are to revolt against social norms, such as gangs, it can cause a negative social capital for the area causing those who disagreed with these organizations to relocate thus taking their positive social capital to a different space than the negative. Another area where social capital can be seen as an area of study in geography is through the analysis of participation in volunteerism and its support of different governments. One area to look into with this is through those who participate in social organizations. People that participate are of different races, ages, and economic status.With these in mind, variances of the space in which these different demographics may vary, causing a difference in involvement among areas. Secondly, there are different social programs for different areas based on economic situation.A governmental organization would not place a welfare center in a wealthier neighborhood where it would have very limited support to the community, as it is not needed. Thirdly, social capital can be affected by the participation of individuals of a certain area based on the type of institutions that are placed there.Mohan supports this with the argument of J. Fox in his paper \"Decentralization and Rural Development in Mexico\", which states \"structures of local governance in turn influence the capacity of grassroots communities to influence social investments.\"With this theory, if the involvement of a government in specific areas raises the involvement of individuals in social organizations and/or communities, this will in turn raise the social capital for that area. Since every area is different, the government takes that into consideration and will provide different areas with different institutions to fit their needs thus there will be different changes in social capital in different areas. In the context ofleisure studies, social capital is seen as the consequence of investment in and cultivation of social relationships allowing an individual access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable to him or her.The concept of social capital in relation toleisureis grounded in a perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness rather than the separateness of human activity and human goals. There is a significant connection between leisure and democratic social capital.Specific forms of leisure activity contribute to the development of the social capital central todemocracyand democratic citizenship. The more an individual participates in social activities, the moreautonomythe individual experiences, which will help her or his individual abilities and skills to develop. The greater the accumulation of social capital a person experiences, may transfer to other leisure activities as well as personal social roles, relationships and in other roles within asocial structure. Kislev (2019) shows that following vast changes to the status of marriage in modern society singles present higher social capital. They also derive greater happiness from equal levels of social capital compared with married people.In a later study, Kislev (2020) shows the relation between romantic relationships desire and singleness. He shows that a lower degree of relationship desire has a significant effect on the relative importance of friends. Furthermore, both higher levels of the relative importance of friends and social satisfaction are negatively correlated with relationship desire. Social capital has been associated with the reduction in access to informal credit in informal economies (especially in developing countries).Social capital in rural communities bring business-related knowledge and skills, entrepreneurial wellbeing, and economic benefits for individuals within communities, while for the community as a whole, strong social capital also brings extra shared economic benefits, and it can also foster socio-cultural change within the community. Similar results were revealed in across-sectional studyrun by Sarker inBangladesh.Some other authors also note the importance of social capital among female entrepreneurship. Epo (2013) presented the case that social capital and micro loans increase the likelihood of female entrepreneurship inCameroon.Epo did this by comparing the welfare outcomes of the entrepreneurs who both had access and no access. Other authors, however, disagree about the positive correlation between social capital andmicrofinance, Kanak and Iiguni argue that formation of social capital is largely dependent on strategies implemented by Microfinance Institutions.Kanak and Iiguni determined this while investigating social capital formation in a rural village in Bangladesh. For their study inIndianrural communities, Trivedi and colleagues make a distinction between internal social capital, i.e. within a rural community, and external social capital, i.e., between people from the community with people outside the community. They argue that both internal and external social capital need to be in place for a rural community to create entrepreneurial and economic benefits, which in turn can reduce poverty.",

Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known ascrest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass ordetention basinwhen the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.  Valves used in floodgate applications have a variety of design requirements and are usually located at the base of dams. Often, the most important requirement (besides regulating flow) is energy dissipation. Since water is very heavy, it exits the base of a dam with the enormous force of water pushing from above. Unless this energy is dissipated, the flow can erode nearby rock and soil and damage structures. Other design requirements include taking into accountpressure headoperation, the flow rate, whether the valve operates above or below water, and the regulation of precision and cost. The force on a rectangular flood gate can be calculated by the followingequation: where: If the rectangular flood gate is submerged below the surface the same equation can be used but only the height from the water surface to the middle of the gate must be used to calculate the force on the flood gate.",

It specializes inseed stage, early stage, and growth stage investments in private companies across technology sectors.As of January 2025, the firm had approximately US$56 billion inassets under management(AUM). The firm operates three regionally-focused venture entities, as Sequoia in Europe, Peak XV Partners in Southeast Asia, andHongShanin China.Sequoia has made a wide variety of venture investments since inception, including inApple,ByteDance, andCisco, among many others. Sequoia was founded byDon Valentinein 1972 in Menlo Park, California,at a time when the state's venture capital industry was just beginning to develop.Sequoia formed its first venture capital fund in 1974,and was an early investor inAtarithe next year.In 1978, Sequoia became one of the first investors inApple.PartnersDoug LeoneandMichael Moritzassumed leadership of the firm in 1996. In 1999, Sequoia established a dedicated investment fund for Israeli startups.In 2005, Sequoia Capital China was established,later followed by Sequoia Capital India.In 2012, Moritz took a step back from the day-to-day operations of the firm.Leone became Global Managing Partner.Jim Goetzled Sequoia's U.S. business from 2012 until 2017, when he was succeeded byRoelof Botha.In 2016, Sequoia hiredJess Lee, making her the first female investing partner in the United States in the firm's history.In 2019, it was the most activeVC fundcompany in India. In March 2020, Sequoia announced it would hire Luciana Lixandru as its first partner based in Europe.In October 2021, Sequoia announced it would implement a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business that would allow it to remain involved with companies after their public market debuts.In March 2022,The Informationreported that Sequoia Capital China was raising an $8 billion fund to invest in Chinese tech companies.Following thecollapse of Silicon Valley Bankin March 2023, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporationhad backstopped Sequoia's $1billion in deposits in the bank. In June 2023, Sequoia announced plans to break up into three entities citing complications running a decentralized global investment business in the middle of geopolitical tensions.Following the separation, expected to complete by March 2024, the Chinese business led byNeil Shenwould be calledHongShan(\"sequoia\" in Mandarin) and the Indian and Southeast Asia arm would be named Peak XV Partners. The U.S. and Europe unit would retain the Sequoia name.In July 2023, Sequoia announced to cut one-third of its talent staff as part of an organizational restructuring.In October 2023, theU.S. House Committee on U.S.–China Competitionannounced a probe into Sequoia Capital's investments in China. As of at least 2024, Sequoia is the largest investor inChina's consumer internet sector.It has often used a strategy of investing in several competitors in the same sector and then later pushing for their consolidation.According toChinese media, Sequoia was one of the major influences in mergers betweenMeituanandDianping, betweenUber ChinaandDidi, and between VShop and Lefenghui. In July 2025, Sequoia partnerShaun Maguirestated thatZohran Mamdani, aMuslim AmericanNew York Citymayoralcandidate, \"came from a culture that lies about everything\" and seeks to advance \"hisIslamistagenda\".That statement was widely denounced as bigoted and Islamophobic.In response, 600 founders of tech startups signed an open letter to Sequoia, asking Sequoia to adopt \"azero-tolerance policyonhate speechandreligious bigotry.\"In August 2025, Sequoia's COO, Sumaiya Balbale, who is open about the influence of her Muslim faith on her career, resigned after five years with the company over Maguire's posts after other senior partners decline to take action against Maguire on the basis of free speech. In November 2025, Botha was succeeded byAlfred Linand Pat Grady as joint managing partners of the firm.The pair became known as \"stewards,\" in line with the firm's stewardship model created by Don Valentine. Investors, referred to as limited partners, contribute money to a fund that the firm's general partners then invest in business ventures.Its limited partners have primarily been university endowments, charitable foundations, and other large institutions.Sequoia specializes in seed stage,early stage,and growth stageinvestments in private technology companies,including those in the clean tech, consumer internet, crypto, financial services, healthcare, mobile, and robotics sectors.The firm has been often recognized for its strong track record of early investments.The firm has also distinguished itself from other top venture capital firms by diversifying its investments and not just focusing on U.S. early-stage venture capital.Sequoia is an umbrella brand for three different venture entities: one focused on the U.S. and Europe, another on India and Southeast Asia, and a third on China.Following the June 2023 announcement to make the three entities independent, from 2024 the ventures would no longer share investors or profits. A notable opportunity missed by Sequoia was the failure to invest inFacebookin its early days c. 2005;John Naughtonsuggested that this failure led to \"fear of missing out\" and may have contributed to Sequoia's investing heavily in FTX in 2022, prior to its collapse in 2023.In 2019,Hurun Research Instituteidentified Sequoia as the world's topunicorninvestor, noting it had invested in one in five of all private companies valued at $1 billion or more.In July 2021, Sequoia published a piece about \"the Latin American startup opportunity\" that signaled it would increase its focus there. In October 2021, Sequoia announced the Sequoia Capital Fund, a new fund structure for its U.S. and European business.The fund structure is unique for VC funds as they are typically funds with a 10-year fund cycle instead of an open-ended evergreen fund.The Sequoia fund will no longer need to sell or distribute stock as in the usual VC fund cycle. Instead, limited partners who want liquidity can pull money out of the fund.Sequoia also announced it would become aRIAwhich would allow the firm more flexibility in its investments.In February 2022, Sequoia raised a $600 million Sequoia Crypto Fund.

As of March 27, 2014, the firm was managing $4 billion in assets following the closing of its fourth fund at $1.5 billion. In addition to Andreessen and Horowitz, the firm's general partners includeJohn O'Farrell,Scott Weiss,Jeff Jordan,Peter Levine,Chris Dixon,Vijay Pande,Martin Casado, and Andrew Chen.Ex-VMwareCEO Raghu Raghuram joined the firm as general partner in October 2025.Margit Wennmachersserved as operating partner from 2010 to July 2025, when she became partner emeritus.

As per the websiteOfficeChai's calculations (up to October 2025), since 2020, Andreessen Horowitz has backed 32unicorns, more than any other venture firm.By November 2025, Andreessen Horowitz's website lists 1076 portfolio companies.The note reads: \"Any investments or portfolio companies mentioned, referred to, or described on this page are not representative of all investments in vehicles managed by a16z and there can be no assurance that the investments will be profitable or that other investments made in the future will have similar characteristics or results. Exits include current and former a16z portfolio companies which have been acquired as well as companies which have undergone an initial public offering or direct public offering of shares. Certain publicly traded companies on this list may still be held in Andreessen Horowitz funds.\"The American Dynamism section lists 50 companies. Leslie Feinzaigwrites onFast Companythat nowadays Andreessen Horowitz and other big firms do not act like traditional venture capital firms anymore, but invest beyond early-stage private companies, including public equities, crypto tokens, non-traditional assets, and more. There is also a tendency towards competing for the obvious alpha, and not just making the contrarian's bet. In 2023, the firm launched a $600 million American Dynamism fund \"with the broad aim of supporting companies building in the nation’s interest\".The fund focuses on hard tech sectors which serve national interest, including space, defense, manufacturing, robotics.

The summit is officially non-partisan and has partnered with Democratic defense officials like former Deputy Secretary of DefenseKathleen Hicks. The fund is managed by three general partners, namelyKatherine Boyle,David Ulevitchand Erin Price-Wright. Boyle plays an important role in the initiative. She declares in her essay In an essay titled \"Building American Dynamism\" that, \"I believe the only way to reverse the course of stagnation and kick-start nationwide renewal post-Covid is through technologists building companies that support the national interest.\" She has previous interned atFounders Fundand is influenced by Peter Thiel's thinking. In 2016, she joinedGeneral Catalystwhere she helped fundAnduril, before joining Andreessen Horowitz. Her portfolio at Andreessen Horowitz includesHadrian(manufacturing in aerospace and defense), Apex Space (satellites) and Castelion (hypersonic weapons). In 2009, Andreessen Horowitz made its first two investments: one in business management SaaS developerApptioand one inSkypestock.

Benchmark was founded in 1995by five partners:Bob Kagle,Bruce Dunlevie,Andy Rachleff,Kevin Harvey,and Val Vaden.The firm is noted for creating the first equal ownership and compensation structure for its partners,where there are no \"junior partners\" or \"senior partners,\" and there are also noCEO-like position held,differing from other VC firms which are named for their founders and are structured hierarchically.The firm has stated the reason for maintaining this approach is to \"force discipline and accountability to focus on what matters\" for its founders and limited partners,as their profits are driven by investment performance as opposed to management fees.The collective decision-making structure also means that Benchmark shares responsibility for the performance of the companies the firm invests in, not just the single partner who joins the company's board of directors. Prior partners with the firm includeBill Gurley(who stepped back from his position after serving with the firm for twenty-one years),Mitch Lasky, andMatt Cohler(who each stepped back from their roles as partners after each spending more than a decade with the firm). The firm's most successful investment was a 1997 investment of $6.7 million ineBayfor 22.1% of the company.In 2011, it invested $12 million for an 11% stake inUber, worth $7 billion in 2019 and $9.4 billion in 2023. Benchmark’s first eight funds, raised and invested between 1995 and 2019, returned more than seven and a half times the money invested, net of fees andcarry. The firm has made exits from several companies,includingAmplitude,Asana,Confluent,eBay,Elastic,New Relic,Nextdoor,Red Hat,Snap,Stitch Fix,andUber. Benchmark Capital has faced scrutiny regarding its relationships with company founders and its role in leadership changes at portfolio companies. The firm's actions have raised questions about the balance between investor oversight and founder autonomy in venture capital. In August 2017, Benchmark filed a lawsuit against Uber co-founder and former CEOTravis Kalanick, alleging that he had misled the board in order to gain control of additional board seats.The lawsuit sought Kalanick's removal from Uber's board of directors and was described as \"unprecedented\" in Silicon Valley venture capital circles.The litigation was eventually dismissed in January 2018 as a condition of SoftBank's investment in Uber. Beyond Uber, Benchmark has been involved in leadership changes at multiple portfolio companies. According to media reports, Benchmark partnerBill Gurleyassisted the board atNextdoorin replacing founder Nirav Tolia as CEO.Additional reports have documented the firm's involvement in leadership changes at other portfolio companies, including solar technology company Nanosolar, where founder Martin Roscheisen was removed from his position. Roscheisen later characterized Benchmark as \"the backstabber of all founders\" and stated he would never accept investment from the firm again. The Uber lawsuit and other founder departures generated significant criticism within the startup community. Following the Uber litigation, several entrepreneurs expressed reluctance to work with Benchmark. Gabriel Puliatti, founder of startup Emptor, stated there was \"no way\" he would accept investment from Benchmark, saying he \"empathized a lot with Travis\" during the events. Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs predicted the lawsuit would have a \"chilling effect\" on the next generation of talent, with industry observers noting that Benchmark would have to answer \"awkward questions in a lot of deals for the foreseeable future.\"Investor Hazem Awad commented that \"any entrepreneur would naturally feel nervous about working with Benchmark, at least for the time being,\" citing concerns about \"what will happen if things get that bad.\" The controversy prompted discussion on social media, with entrepreneurs expressing concerns about Benchmark's approach to founder relations. One entrepreneur in Hong Kong, Larry Salibra, wrote that the \"cost of accepting investment from Benchmark just went through the roof in minds of founders everywhere.\" Delian Asparouhov ofFounders Fundcriticized Benchmark's approach, stating: \"I don't know how you explain to founders, 'Hey, the way I do early-stage investing is — I bet on founders,' and then you have this track record of explicitly not betting on founders.\"Asparouhov argued that venture capital firms with a history of removing founders could lose access to the most sought-after deals. Some industry observers defended Benchmark's actions as necessary corporate governance.Mark SusterofUpfront Venturesstated: \"There are people who are old enough and wise enough, to have a long enough lens, to say, 'You know what, governance matters.'\" Benchmark Capital was featured in theApple TV+original TV seriesWeCrashedstarringJared LetoandAnne Hathaway. In the show,Anthony Edwardsportrays Benchmark co-founder Bruce Dunlevie, who became WeWork's first major investor on the 1st of April in 2012 when Benchmark led WeWork's $17 million Series-A seed funding. Benchmark was also featured in theShowtimeoriginalSuper PumpedstarringJoseph Gordon-Levitt.

    "text": " Founders Fundis an Americanventure capitalfund formed in 2005 and based inSan Francisco. The fund has roughly $17 billion in totalassets under managementas of 2025.Founders Fund was the first institutional investor in Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) andPalantir Technologies, and an early investor inFacebook.The firm's partners have been founders, early employees and investors at companies includingPayPal,Palantir Technologies,Anduril Industriesand SpaceX. The firm's investments includeAirbnb,Anduril,DeepMind,Rippling,Facebook,Ramp,Palantir Technologies,Pudgy Penguins, SpaceX,Spotify,Stripe,Neuralink, andNubank. Notable partners includePeter Thiel,Trae Stephens, andMike Solana.Former partners includeBrian Singerman,Keith Rabois,Cyan Banister,Ken Howery,Kevin Hartz,Sean Parker,andBruce Gibney. The firm was organized byPeter Thiel,Ken Howery, andLuke Nosekin early 2005 and raised its firstfundof $50 million from individual entrepreneurs andangel investorsin January of that year.Sean Parker, co-founder ofNapsterand ex-president ofFacebook, joined in 2006.In 2007, the firm raised a new fund of $220 million. In 2010, the firm raised its third fund, with $250 million in committed capital,and in 2011, a fourth fund with $625 million of committed capital was raised. In 2014, Founders Fund raised a $1 billion fifth suite of funds, bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $2 billion. In 2016, Founders Fund raised a sixth, $1.3 billion fund, bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $3 billion. In 2020, Founders Fund raised a seventh flagship fund and its first growth fund, representing $3 billion in new capital and bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $6 billion. In 2022, Founders Fund raised an eighth flagship fund and its second growth fund, representing over $5 billion in new capital and bringing the firm's aggregate capital under management to more than $11 billion. In March 2023, Founders Fund cut the size of its eighth venture capital fund in half, from around $1.8 billion to around $900 million, to adapt to uncertain market conditions. This was the idea of Thiel, who thought \"venture capital is due for a slimdown\", which caused some resistance from inside the firm. In 2025, Founders Fund raised its third growth fund, Founders Fund Growth III, at $4.6 billion for late-stage investments.Julie Bort ofTechCrunchremarks that, \"Founders Fund is so big and successful that it can always raise an oversubscribed fund should it choose to.\" The oversubsription seemed to anticipate an era of big VC spending, and also expansion of the defense sector.Meanwhile,CNBCcommented that, \"Hefty amounts of private capital are likely to be needed for the foreseeable future as the IPO market remains virtually dormant\". The Founders Fund was conceptualized as an early-stage venture capital fund. From the start, it has adopted Thiel's contrarian attitude, and bet early and aggressively on companies with the founders it deemed deserving of trust. Early in its history, it made many investments in internet or social media and health and life science research, among which there were investments inSpotify,Airbnb, andLyft.By 2006, Jessica Guynn ofSFGatecharacterized it as a tiny but influential fund focusing on consumer internet, standing beside Thiel's then extraordinarily successful firmClarium Capital. Later, together with Thiel's disillusion with social media companies, the firm has gradually developed into a primary backer ofhard techand defense technology. In 2011, when the social bubble was still expanding, he complained, \"Is Twitter worth $7 billion?\" At this time, the Founders Fund had developed a portfolio in artificial intelligence, biotech and space technology. In 2017, it published the manifesto \"What happened to the future?\", written byBruce Gibney. The manifesto denied that the Internet's potential had been exhausted, but emphasized that the Founders' Fund would focus on ambitious projects that resolved real challenges. The original subtitle was Thiel's famous motto \"We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\" Julie Bort, the venture editor atTechcrunchremarks that it boasts perhaps the most formidable defense portfolio in the Silicon Valley.The Founders Fund,Andreessen Horowitz, America's Frontier Fund, as well as the leaders of these firms, namely Peter Thiel,Marc AndreessenandEric Schmidt, are often considered the dominance forces in the new defense tech domain.Camden Mead writes on the website of the Utah Aerospace and Defense Association that, together with Andreessen Horowitz, the Founders Fund \"has prioritized investing in revolutionary technologies, including various forms of autonomous vehicles. Both of these firms are relatively new to the defense space but are singlehandedly changing how traditional investors view the aerospace, deep tech, and defense ecosystem.\" The firm also turned to investing in companies in both early and later stages of development. Its first fund dedicated to late-stage startups was created in 2019.At the annual meeting in September 2025, partners indicated the firm’s third growth fund would invest about $460 million per company (with a total of 10 portfolio companies), compared with $225 million in its second fund (with 15 companies) and $55 million in its first (with 31 companies), showing a turn towards concentrated late-stage bets. Structure-wise, there are three directors, each with powers to veto over any deals over  $10 million.It is known, though, as in his other companies, that Thiel prefers to surround himself with people who share his thinking and loyal to him, and often manages to steer them to partnership, as seen in the cases of Keith Rabois,Sean Parker,Max Marmeror Trae Stephens.The tech writer Mario Gabrielewrites that, \"At the heart of Thiel’s power, influence, and wealth is Founders Fund. No organization has benefited more from his singular abilities, and those of the team he has assembled, than the venture firm.\" Thiel and other partners invest substantial amounts of their own money in the fund. Thiel contributed  $38 million  to the Founders Fund's Fund 1 (2005). In 2023, Thiel invested $920 million (27%). By late 2018, the firm was returning $4.60 to its investors on every dollar invested. The industry average of that year was $2.11. In October 2024, the Founders Fund hosted the invite-only \"Hereticon: Apocalypse Ball\", an event they described as \"a conference for thoughtcrime\", to display and celebrate \"technologies and projects so ambitious, they will ultimately transform our world for the better – or destroy it\". The invitation reads, \"Maybe if you are not trying to destroy the world, you are not trying hard enough\". The firm has a longtime rivalry with one of Thiel's other venture companies,Mithril Capital. In 2021, the Founders Fund opened aMiamioffice. The Founders Fund was co-founded by Thiel, Howery, and Nosek. Ken Howery, co-founder and former partner, was also a co-founder of PayPal and the Founders Fund's  first chief financial officer. At the Founders Fund, he led or co-led investments in Facebook,Quantcast,ZocDocandGeni. He is now a diplomat, having served asthe U.S. ambassador to Sweden, and has been confirmed by the Senate as the nextU.S. ambassador to DenmarkIn his college years, he was the editor-in-chief ofThe Stanford Review, a student newspaper found by Thiel. In 2017,Luke Nosek, one of the co-founders, left the Founders Fund to establish Gigafund, which focuses on space technology and Musk companies like Neuralink and theBoring Company(initially it mainly focused on SpaceX). The other Gigafund co-founder,  Stephen Oskoui, is also a former Founders Fund investor.When at Founders Fund. Nosek led the investment in SpaceX and remains a board member ever since.Nosek was instrumental in the investment, at a time SpaceX was vulnerable. Thiel was persuaded, partly out of the desire to mend his personal relationship with Musk due to previous problems atPayPal(Thiel had also previously refused to invest inTesla– Musk thinks it was because of his skepticism of climate change]. By April 2025, Peter Thiel, Napoleon Ta andTrae Stephensare listed as fund directors. Currently the sole female partner is Lauren Gross, also the COO, who leads all non-investment activities from legal to finance. Trae Stephens, also a partner, has played an important role in co-founding and developing companies incubated at the Founders Fund, includingAnduril Industries(where he is now chairman), Sol (at one point Sindarin Inc.), which develops a wearable e-reader,Varda Space Industries (co-founder, alongside Thiel fellow Delian Asparouhov and formerSpaceXengineer Will Bruey; also director),and Valinor Enterprises.  In 2024, he co-founded Valinor alongside former Palantir's senior vice president Julie Bush (CEO), General Catalyst's Paul Kwan and Red Cell's Grant Verstandig.The team is sourced fromPalantir Technologies,Anduril IndustriesandHelsing. The firm also holds strategic relationships with these companies.Valinor participates in Anduril's Lattice Partner Program,and the two companies are also members of the Defense Industrial Base Consortium.Stephens also sits on the board ofFlexport(he led the Founders Fund's investment in the company).Stephens had initially worked for Palantir.Alex Karp, the CEO, told him that he would not let Stephens meet Thiel because he would be poached from Palantir. Karp managed to keep the two separated for two years, until 2012. Stephens began to work for the Founders Fund in 2013.The Founders Fund's $1 billion investment in Anduril's 2025 Series G is the fund's largest investment in history, and the $2.5 billion collected in total was the second largest sum invested in a defense company in 2025, only behind the aerospace company's $2.6 billion Series E. Ryan PetersenofFlexportis a partner. In 2016, reacting to Peter Thiel's support for Trump, Petersen said that he regretted to have accepted investment from the Founders Fund.In 2023, he decided to join the fund though. Delian Asparouhov is currently a partner.AThiel fellow, he founded the space companyVarda Space Industriestogether with former SpaceX engineer Will Bruey. Varda works on in-space manufacturing, especially in-space drug manufacturing, and also provides a testbest for hypersonic technology as well as \"materials for heat shields, navigation systems and flight computers\" for theU.S. Department of Defense. In 2025, they raised $187 million in funding. The founders emphasize that the technologies they use are not new, what is new is the innovative model that combines all elements together.In 2025, the startup carried out a Mach 25 plus mission together with theAir Force Research Laboratory(AFRL) andNASA'sAmes Research Center.The Founders Fund is the incubator of the startup and one of its financial backers.In 2025, the Founders Fund invested $43 million in Asparouhov's home country Bulgaria's satellite startup EnduroSat. Scott Nolan is a partner. In 2025 he co-foundedGeneral Matter, a new nuclear fuel startup which he co-founds and which is considered the third part of a trilogy incubated at the Founders Fund (following Palantir and Anduril).When at SpaceX, Nolan helped to develop the Merlin engine systems and the Dragon capsule.He stays as a partner but will give his full focus on General Matter and the companies he has previously backed. Brian Singermanis a partner emeritus. He continues as strategic advisor and investor. He is seeking $500 million for a new fund named GPx. Mike Solanais the chief marketing officer. He is the founder ofPirate Wires. Keith Raboisis anotherPayPal Mafiamember. His connection with Thiel began when he served inThe Stanford Review's staff under Thiel (When Howery joined Stanford, Thiel and Rabois had graduated). He leftKhosla Venturesto join the Founders Fund in 2019. He returned to Khosla in 2024. Bruce Gibneyis also a formerStanford Revieweditor-in-chief. At Stanford, he was also Howery's roommate. He and his family were early investors inConfinity, which later formedPayPal. He worked for Thiel at Clarium Capital, where he advised Thiel on the $500,000 investment in Facebook. Later, he moved to the Founders Fund and worked as growth partner. He left in November 2012. He also works as a writer and litigator. Sean Parkerworked at the Founders Fund between 2006 and 2014. In 2010, when the Founders Fund invested inSpotify, he became a member of Spotify's board. He is also the founder of the Parker Foundation, an philanthropic organization. In 2016,Bloombergnoted that Founders Fund added roughly one member to their investment team per year.Cyan Banisterwas the Founders Fund's first female investing partner.In 2019, she helped organize a protest in solidarity withHong Kong protestersand urged Silicon Valley to sever the ties with China.She marriedPayPal MafiamemberScott Banister. Now she leads Long Journey Ventures alongside Arielle Zuckerberg, sister ofMark Zuckerberg. Tristan Abbey worked atClarium Capitaland the Founders Fund. He is currently the 11th administrator of theU.S. Energy Information Administration. He was an editor atThe Stanford Reviewtoo. Justin Fishner-Wolfson and S. Alexander Jacobson are former investors at Founders Fund. They are co-founders and partners at 137 Ventures (together with Kathy Chan, formerly at Khosla Ventures), which invests in Palantir, Anduril, SpaceX, Airbnb, Flexport. The Founders Fund have incubated or co-incubatedPalantir Technologies,Anduril Industries,General Matter, Valinor,Varda Space Industries, which are all defense company; only Sol is a non-military company.). Other than these companies andSpaceX, the Founders Fund makes investments in other notable companies or projects that have strategical value for defense, security or government affairs, including: Miles Kruppa revealed that Founders Fund was sitting on a more than $19.5 billion gain from its investment in SpaceX since it started investing in 2008—more than its total assets under management! Peter Thiel, the firm’s founder, lives in Los Angeles.\nAnd Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf told Jessica Lessin on TITV last week that its revenue would double—but it wasn’t yet making money. \"Growing a hardware company at the rate we’re growing at turns out to be really expensive,\" he said.\nThere’s a fascinating business story here about the reinvention of both the tech industry and the national defense complex. But there’s also something broader in the air: realpolitik. Tech is getting built and funded with an eye toward serving national interests and, importantly, getting close to power. Ideals only take you so far. Robotics is natural dual-use technology,but companies listed here have focused on civilian applications. In 2019,Cyan Banistercommented on the reason she and the Founders Fund continued to invest in game companies: \"In 2018 I was obsessed with the idea of how you can bring AI and entertainment together [...] I also became obsessed with live and interactive mobile-first entertainment, making investments in HQ Trivia, Drivetime, Bunch and Glamcam. When anyone says that consumer is over, I disagree. I believe we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift of how consumers behave and it's the beginning of new social fabric and design that pushes devices in ways never before thought imaginable.\"",

In 2001, Coleman established Tiger Technology (which would be later renamed to Tiger Global Management, LLC),as ahedge fundto invest in thepublic equitymarket. In 2003,Scott Shleiferhelped Tiger Global expand into investing in theprivate equitymarket. From the period of 2007 to 2017, according to thePreqinVenture Report, Tiger Global raised the highest amount of capital amongventure capitalfirms.

DST Global's founder isYuri Milnerand its co-founders are Saurabh Gupta, John Lindfors, Rahul Mehta and Tom Stafford.The company was founded in 2009 as a spinoff from Russian company Digital Sky Technologies, which becameMail.ru Group(later the VK company). In the early 2010s, DST Global international investments were focused on emerging markets such asChina. Yuri Milnerfounded Digital Sky Technologies (now known asVK) in 1999that through acquisitions has become a leading Russian language website in terms of users.In 2010, Digital Sky Technologies changed its name to Mail.ru Group and successfully completed aninitial public offeringon theLondon Stock Exchange.Although initial investments in American Internet companies were done by Mail.ru, it became clear that a dedicated fund management operation was required to continue investing at scale. As a result, DST Global was set up in 2009 by Yuri Milner as a separate fund management company for international investments.In 2012, Milner stepped down from his role asMail.ruChairman to fully focus on DST Global.In the capital of the third fund, Milner and Usmanov, as in the case of the second fund, contributed $50 million worth of Facebook shares. Special conditions were offered for investors of the first two funds. They could buy Facebook shares at a 12% discount to the \"internal valuation\" calculated using the DST method: at that time, the entire Facebook company was valued at $74 billion, for investors - $9 billion less. In addition, these investors paid fund managers 25% less than everyone else. In July 2015, the formation of the DST Global V fund began; by August, it had raised $1.7 billion. The composition of shareholders, as well as the final size of the fund, are unknown. The main capital was attracted from private sovereign funds and private individual investors. Since the Mail.ru Group's IPO, DST Global is the sole vehicle for further international investments. The company is now fully independent of Mail.ru Group. DST Global has offices inMenlo Park,New York,London, andHong Kong.The registered office of the DST Global funds is in theCayman Islands. Notable investments of the DST Global includeFacebook,Twitter,WhatsApp,Snapchat,Spotify,Alibaba,Toutiao/ByteDanceandXiaohongshu. A Kremlin-owned firm,VTB Bank, put $191 million into DST Global, which used it to buy a large share ofTwitterin 2011. A subsidiary of the Kremlin-controlledGazpromfunded an investment company that partnered with DST Global to buy shares inFacebook, reaping millions when the social media giant went public in 2012.Twittersimilarly went public in 2013. The US government sanctioned VTB in 2014 because of theRussian military intervention in Crimea, but DST Global had sold its stake in Twitter by then. Four days after the FacebookIPO, a DST Global subsidiary sold more than 27 million shares of Facebook for roughly $1 billion.In November 2017, DST Global issued the statement in response to this accusation: “Since 2009, DST Global has invested $7 billion in the consumer internet sector, with a majority being invested in non-U.S. companies — and with less than 5% coming from VTB Bank. VTB Bank was the only Russian government institution that invested in any DST Global funds... Moreover, there were dozens of DST Global investors making up the funds that invested in Facebook and Twitter — ....50 passive investors that invested in Facebook..., and VTB Bank was one of 40 passive investors... that invested in Twitter”Yuri Milner published his own open letter in ReCode magazine stated that \"DST Global's investments in Silicon Valley were motivated by pure business logic, based on a decade of experience in Internet technology... when we negotiated the Facebook and Twitter deals we asked for no board seats, and assigned all our votes to their founders, figuring they knew best how to run their companies. At the time, this structure was unusual, but it is core to DST Global's philosophy.\"DST Global funds have invested in over 80 companies, none of which are based in Russia. In 2022, due to additional sanctions being placed on Russia resulting from the2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, DST Global became a subject of scrutiny due to its ties to Russia.A DST Global representative stated that the firm had not raised capital from Russian limited partners since 2011.Less than 3% of capital it had raised from inception was from VTB Bank and all such capital was returned by 2014.On DST Global's website, the firm announced it condemned Russia's war against Ukraine.In addition the firm donated $3 million to Stand With Ukraine, aGoFundMeinitiative launched byMila KunisandAshton Kutcherto help the refugee and humanitarian relief efforts. Milner said, \"The great irony is that we are the least Russian fund right now and have been because we made a consistent effort.\" He toldBloomberg Newsthat DST hasn't taken money from Russia since a $900 million fund in 2011, and most Western banks were in business with Russia until years after he stopped.",

    "text": " Blackstone Inc.is an Americanalternative investmentmanagement company based in New York City. It was founded in 1985 as amergers and acquisitionsfirm byPeter PetersonandStephen Schwarzman, who had previously worked together atLehman Brothers. Blackstone'sprivate equitybusiness has been one of the largest investors inleveraged buyoutsin the last three decades, while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate across the globe. Blackstone is also active in credit, infrastructure,hedge funds, secondaries, growth equity, and insurance solutions. As of September 30, 2025, Blackstone has $1.2 trillion in totalassets under management, making it the world's largest alternative investment firm. Blackstone was founded in 1985 byPeter G. PetersonandStephen A. SchwarzmanwithUS$400,000(equivalent to $1.2million in 2024) inseed capital.The founders derived their firm's name from their names: \"Schwarz\" is German for \"black\"; \"Peter\", \"petros\" (πέτρος, masculine), or \"petra\" (πετρα, feminine) means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in Greek.The two founders had previously worked together atLehman Brothers. There, Schwarzman served as head of global mergers and acquisitions business.Prominent investment bankerRoger C. Altman, another Lehman veteran, left his position as a managing director ofLehman Brothersto join Peterson and Schwarzman at Blackstone in 1987, but left in 1992 to join theClinton administrationasDeputy Treasury Secretaryand later founded advisory investment bankEvercore Partnersin 1995. Blackstone was originally formed as a mergers and acquisitions advisory boutique. It advised on the 1987 merger of investment banksE. F. Hutton & Co.and Shearson Lehman Brothers, collecting a $3.5 million fee. From the outset in 1985, Schwarzman and Peterson planned to enter the private equity business but had difficulty in raising their first fund because neither had ever led a leveraged buyout.Blackstone finalized fundraising for its first private equity fund in the aftermath ofBlack Monday, the October 1987 global stock market crash. After two years of providing strictly advisory services, Blackstone decided to pursue a merchant banking model after its founders determined that many situations required an investment partner rather than just an advisor. The largest investors in the first fund includedPrudential Insurance Company,Nikko Securitiesand theGeneral Motorspension fund. Blackstone also ventured into other businesses, most notably investment management. In 1987 Blackstone entered into a 50–50 partnership with the founders ofBlackRock,Larry Fink(current CEO of BlackRock), and Ralph Schlosstein (CEO ofEvercore). The two founders, who had previously run the mortgage-backed securities divisions atFirst Bostonand Lehman Brothers, respectively, initially joined Blackstone to manage an investment fund and provide advice to financial institutions. They also planned to use a Blackstone fund to invest in financial institutions and help build an asset management business specializing in fixed income investments. As the business grew, Japanese bank Nikko Securities acquired a 20% interest in Blackstone for a $100 million investment in 1988 (valuing the firm at $500 million). Nikko's investment allowed for a major expansion of the firm and its investment activities.The growth firm also recruited politician and investment bankerDavid StockmanfromSalomon Brothersin 1988. Stockman led many key deals in his time at the firm but had a mixed record with his investments.He left Blackstone in 1999 to start his own private equity firm,Heartland Industrial Partners, based inGreenwich, Connecticut. The firm advisedCBS Corporationon its 1988 sale of CBS Records toSonyto form what would becomeSony Music Entertainment.In June 1989, Blackstone acquired freight railroad operatorCNW Corporation.The same year, Blackstone partnered with Salomon Brothers to raise $600 million to acquire distressedthriftsin the midst of thesavings and loan crisis. In 1990, Blackstone launched its hedge funds business, initially intended to manage investments for Blackstone senior management.The same year, Blackstone formed a partnership with J. O. Hambro Magan in the UK andIndosuezin France.Blackstone and Silverman also acquired a 65% interest in Prime Motor Inn'sRamadaandHoward Johnsonfranchises for $140 million, creating Hospitality Franchise Systems as aholding company. In 1991, Blackstone created its Europe unitand launched its real estate investment business with the acquisition of a series of hotel businesses underHenry Silverman's leadership. In October 1991, Blackstone and Silverman addedDays Inns of Americafor $250 million.In 1993, Hospitality Franchise Systems acquiredSuper 8 Motelsfor $125 million.Silverman left Blackstone to serve as CEO of HFS, which later becameCendant Corporation. Blackstone made a number of notable investments in the early and mid-1990s, includingGreat Lakes Dredge and Dock Company(1991),Six Flags(1991), US Radio (1994),Centerplate(1995),MEGA Brands(1996). Also, in 1996, Blackstone partnered with theLoewen Group, the second-largest funeral home and cemetery operator in North America, to acquire funeral home and cemetery businesses. The partnership's first acquisition was a $295 million buyout of Prime Succession fromGTCR. In 1995, Blackstone sold its stake in BlackRock toPNC Financial Servicesfor $240 million. Between 1995 and 2014, PNC reported $12 billion in pretax revenues and capital gains from BlackRock. Schwarzman later described the selling of BlackRock as his worst business decision ever. In 1997, Blackstone completed fundraising for its third private equity fund, with approximately $4 billion of investor commitmentsand a $1.1-billion real estate investment fund.Also in 1997, Blackstone made its first investment inAllied Waste.In 1998, Blackstone sold a 7% interest in its management company toAIG, valuing Blackstone at $2.1 billion.In 1999, Blackstone partnered withApollo Managementto provide capital for Allied Waste's acquisition ofBrowning-Ferris Industries. Blackstone's investment in Allied was one of its largest at that point in the firm's history. In 1999, Blackstone launched its mezzanine capital business. It brought in five professionals, led by Howard Gellis from Nomura Holding America's Leveraged Capital Group, to manage the business. Blackstone's investments in the late 1990s includedAMF Group(1996),Haynes International(1997),American Axle(1997),Premcor(1997), CommNet Cellular (1998), Graham Packaging (1998),Centennial Communications(1999),Bresnan Communications(1999), andPAETEC Holding Corp.(1999). Haynes and Republic Technologies International both had problems and ultimately filed bankruptcy. Blackstone's investments in telecommunications businesses—four cable TV systems in rural areas (TW Fanch 1 and 2, Bresnan Communications and Intermedia Partners IV) and a cell phone operator in the Rocky Mountain states (CommNet Cellular) were among the most successful of the era, generating $1.5 billion of profits for Blackstone's funds. Blackstone Real Estate Advisers, its real estate affiliate, bought theWatergate complexin Washington, D.C. in July 1998 for $39 millionand sold it to Monument Realty in August 2004. In October 2000, Blackstone acquired the mortgage for7 World Trade Centerfrom theTeachers Insurance and Annuity Association. In July 2002, Blackstone completed fundraising for a $6.45 billion private equity fund, Blackstone Capital Partners IV, the largest private equity fund at that time. With a significant amount of capital in its new fund, Blackstone was one of a handful of private equity investors capable of completing large transactions in the adverse conditions of theearly 2000s recession. At the end of 2002, Blackstone,Thomas H. Lee Partners, andBain CapitalacquiredHoughton Mifflin Companyfor $1.28 billion. The transaction represented one of the first largeclub dealscompleted since the collapse of thedot-com bubble. In 2002,Hamilton E. Jamesjoined Blackstone, where he serves as president and chief operating officer. He also serves on the firm's executive and management committees, and its board of directors.In late 2002, Blackstone acquiredTRW Automotivein a $4.7 billion buyout, the largest private equity deal announced that year (the deal was completed in early 2003).TRW's parent was acquired byNorthrop Grumman, while Blackstone purchased its automotive parts business, a major supplier of automotive systems.Blackstone also purchased a majority interest inColumbia House, a music-buying club, in mid-2002. Blackstone made a significant investment inFinancial Guaranty Insurance Company(FGIC), amonoline bond insureralongsidePMI Group,The Cypress GroupandCIVC Partners. FGIC incurred heavy losses, along with other bond insurers in the 2008 credit crisis. In 2005, Blackstone was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout ofSunGard, a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. Blackstone's partners in the acquisition wereSilver Lake Partners, Bain Capital,Goldman Sachs Capital Partners,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,Providence Equity Partners, andTPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover ofRJR Nabiscoat the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it ceded to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable for the number of firms involved, the largest club deal completed to that point.The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered crossholdings among firms to be generally unattractive. In 2006, Blackstone launched itslong/short equityhedge fund business, Kailix Advisors. According to Blackstone, as of September 30, 2008, Kailix Advisors had $1.9 billion of assets under management. In December 2008, Blackstone announced that Kailix would be spun off to its management team to form a new fund as an independent entity backed by Blackstone. While Blackstone was active on the corporate investment side, it was also busy pursuing real estate investments. Blackstone acquired Prime HospitalityandExtended Stay Americain 2004. Blackstone followed these investments with the acquisition ofLa Quinta Inns & Suitesin 2005. Blackstone's largest transaction, the $26-billion buyout ofHilton Hotels Corporation, occurred in 2007 under the tenure of Hilton CFOStephen Bollenbach.Extended Stay Hotels was sold toThe Lightstone Groupin July 2007 and Prime Hospitality'sWellesley Innswere folded into La Quinta.La Quinta Inns & Suites wasspun outfor IPO in 2014 and later acquired byWyndham Hotels & Resorts. During the buyout boom of 2006 and 2007, Blackstone completed some of the largest leveraged buyouts. Its most notable transactions during this period included: In 2004, Blackstone had explored the possibility of creating abusiness development company(BDC), Blackridge Investments, similar to vehicles pursued by Apollo Management.Blackstone failed to raise capital through an initial public offering that summer and the project were shelved.It also planned to raise a fund on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 2006, but its rival, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., launched a $5-billion fund there that soaked up all demand for such funds, and Blackstone abandoned its project. In 2007, Blackstone acquired Alliant Insurance Services, an insurance brokerage firm. The company was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2012. On June 21, 2007, Blackstone became a public company via an initial public offering, selling a 12.3% stake in the company for $4.13 billion, in the largest U.S. IPO since 2002. During the2008 financial crisis, Blackstone closed only a few transactions. In January 2008, Blackstone made a small co-investment alongside TPG Capital and Apollo Management in their buyout ofHarrah's Entertainment, although that transaction had been announced during the buyout boom period. Other notable investments that Blackstone completed in 2008 and 2009 includedAlliedBarton, Performance Food Group,Apria Healthcare, andCMS Computers. In July 2008, Blackstone, NBC Universal, and Bain Capital acquired The Weather Channel fromLandmark Communicationsfor $3.5 billion. In 2015, the digital assets were sold toIBMfor $2 billion. In 2018, the remainder of the company was sold toByron Allenfor $300 million. In December 2009, Blackstone acquiredBusch Entertainment CorporationfromAnheuser-Busch InBevfor $2.9 billion. In November 2013, Merlin Entertainments, owned in part by Blackstone Group, became a public company via an initial public offering on theLondon Stock Exchange. In August 2010, Blackstone announced it would buyDynegy, an energy firm, for nearly $5 billion, but the acquisition was terminated in November 2010. In July 2025,a mass shooting occurredat the Manhattan headquarters of Blackstone. The gunman, identified as 27-year-old Shane Devon Tamura, entered the building wearing body armor and carrying an AR-15–style rifle. He opened fire in the lobby, killing four people. The victims included Wesley LePatner, a senior managing director at Blackstone and CEO of the real estate fund BREIT, an off-duty New York City police officer working security, a security guard, and another employee in the building. In May 2023, Blackstone entered into an agreement to divest its stake in IBS Software, a Kerala-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider. The transaction, valued at $450 million, involved the sale of Blackstone's stake to the global private equity firmApax. In October 2023, Blackstone divested its stake in the Spanish hotel conglomerate Hotel Investment Partners (HIP) to the Singaporean sovereign wealth fundGIC. As part of the agreement, GIC secured a 35% stake in HIP, with the deal establishing a valuation exceeding €4 billion for the company. In December 2023, Blackstone announced its intention to divest its entire 23.59% stake, valued at $833 million, inEmbassy Office Parks, India's largest real estate investment trust. The decision came four years after the initial listing of the REIT, as revealed in a term sheet disclosed byReuters. In April 2025, Blackstone sold its controlling stake in HealthEdge, a US software company, which it had owned since 2020.The company was acquired byBain Capitalin a deal that valued the company at $2.6 billion including debt.

As of 2019, Blackstone was the world's largest private equity firm bycapital commitmentsas ranked byPrivate Equity International's PEI 300 ranking.After dropping to second behindKKRin the 2022 ranking,it regained the top spot in 2023,and retained it in 2024,before slipping to third in the 2025 list.The firm invests through minority investments, corporate partnerships, andindustry consolidations, and occasionallystart-up investments. The firm focuses onfriendly investmentsinlarge capitalization companies. Blackstone has primarily relied onprivate equity funds, pools of committed capital frompension funds,insurance companies, endowments,fund of funds,high-net-worth individuals,sovereign wealth funds, and otherinstitutional investors.From 1987 to its IPO in 2007, Blackstone invested approximately $20 billion in 109 private equity transactions.

Blackstone's most notable real estate investments have includedQTS,EQ Office,Hilton Worldwide,Trizec Properties,Center Parcs UK,La Quinta Inns & Suites,Motel 6,Wyndham Worldwide,Southern Cross HealthcareandVicinity Centres. The purchase and subsequent IPO of Southern Cross led to controversy in the UK. Part of the purchase involved splitting the business into a property company, NHP, and a nursing home business, which Blackstone claimed would become \"the leading company in the elderly care market\". In May 2011, Southern Cross, now independent, was almost bankrupt, jeopardizing 31,000 elderly residents in 750 care homes. It denied blame, although Blackstone was widely accused in the media for selling on the company with an unsustainable business model and crippled with an impossible sale and leaseback strategy. After the 2007–2010subprime mortgage crisisin the United States, Blackstone Group LP bought more than $5.5 billion worth of multi-family homes to rent and be sold when the prices rise. In 2014, Blackstone sold Northern California office buildings for $3.5 billion.The buildings sold in San Francisco and Silicon Valley included 26 office buildings and two development parcels. In 2018, Blackstone's Danish partner North 360 made a purchase agreement on several hundred apartments inFrederiksberg, Denmark, with Frederiksberg Boligfond, a nonprofit housing organization Frederiksberg Municipality established in 1930. After resistance by residents and questions about the purchase agreement's legality, Blackstone withdrew from it in October 2019. On December 1, 2022, Blackstone restricted withdrawals from its $125-billion real estate investment fundBREIT(Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust) due to a surge in redemption requests from investors.The move caused investor consternation and limited the ability to attract new capital for BREIT. In November 2024, Blackstone acquired a group of four retail buildings inSohofor approximately $200 million from ASB Real Estate Investments. This transaction marked the largest Manhattan retail deal by an investor in over three years, signaling a resurgence in the retail asset class. The properties, which house tenants such asPatagoniaand Amiri, were purchased with the strategy of increasing revenue by bringing below-market leases up to current rates. The deal included buildings at 61 Crosby Street, 72-76 Greene Street, 465 Broadway, and 415 West Broadway. In 1990, Blackstone created afund of hedge fundsbusiness to manage internal assets for Blackstone and its senior managers. This business evolved into Blackstone's marketable alternative asset management segment, which was opened to institutional investors. Among the investments included in this segment are funds of hedge funds,mezzanine funds,senior debt vehicles, proprietary hedge funds andclosed-end mutual funds. In March 2008, Blackstone acquiredGSO Capital Partners, a credit-oriented alternative asset manager, for $620 million in cash and stock and up to $310 million through anearnoutover the next five years based on earnings targets. The combined entity created one of the largest credit platforms in the alternative asset management business, with over $21 billion under management.GSO was founded in 2005 by Bennett Goodman, Tripp Smith, and Doug Ostrover. The GSO team had previously managed the leveraged finance businesses atDonaldson, Lufkin & Jenretteand laterCredit Suisse First Boston, after it acquired DLJ. Blackstone was an original investor in GSO's funds. After the acquisition, Blackstone merged GSO's operations with its existing debt investment operations. In separate cases in 2018 and 2019, the hotel chainMotel 6, owned by Blackstone, agreed to settle for $19.6 million for giving guest lists toU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) without a warrant. In 2020, Blackstone acquired a majority stake in Ancestry.com, which controls access to millions of people's genetic data, heightening concern about Blackstone's data privacy practices.This data was disclosed to Blackstone, and it has aggressively defended itself against class action litigation relating to misuse of the data of people who did not consent to genetic testing but were affected through direct biological relations or other means of identification. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor showed thatmore than 100 American children had been working illegally for Packers Sanitation Services Inc.(PSSI), a slaughterhouse cleaning firm owned by Blackstone. The investigation began after a Walnut Middle School teacher inGrand Island, Nebraska, reported a student with hydrochloric acid burns on his hands and knees to the Department of Labor.Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Labor Department fined PSSI $15,138 for each minor who was employed in breach of the law, totaling $1.5 million in civil money penalties. Blackstone has invested in companies with links to the commercialization anddeforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The key trends for Blackstone are (as of the financial year ending December 31)",

    "text": " The Carlyle Group Inc.is an American multinational company with operations inprivate equity, alternativeasset managementandfinancial services. As of 2023, the company had $426 billion of assets under management. Carlyle specializes inprivate equity,real assets, andprivate credit. One of the world's largest investment firms, it ranked first among private equity firms by capital raised from 2010-2015, according to thePEI 300index.In June 2024, it ranked sixth inPrivate Equity International's PEI 300 ranking among the world's largest private equity firms. Founded in 1987 inWashington, D.C., the company has nearly 2,200 employees in 28 offices on four continents as of December 2023. On May 3, 2012, Carlyle completed aUS$700 millioninitial public offeringand began trading on theNASDAQstock exchange. Carlyle was founded in 1987 as aboutique investment bankby five partners with backgrounds in finance and government:William E. Conway Jr.,Stephen L. Norris,David Rubenstein,Daniel A. D'AnielloandGreg Rosenbaum.The founding partners named the firm after theCarlyle HotelinNew York City(named forThomas Carlyle)where Norris and Rubenstein had planned the new investment business.Rubenstein, aWashington-based lawyer, had worked in theCarter Administration.Norris and D'Aneillo had worked together atMarriott Corporation;Conway was a finance executive atMCI Communications.  Rosenbaum left in the first yearand Norris departed in 1995.Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business. Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing fromT. Rowe Price,Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and theRichard King Mellonfamily. In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital deal-by-deal to pursueleveraged buyoutinvestments, including a failed takeover battle forChi-Chi's.The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990.  In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including, in 1991, a $500 million investment in Citigroup byPrince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of theSaudi royal family. Carlyle developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry.  In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.Carlyle would sell the business toTracorin October 1994.Carlyle acquiredMagnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, fromPhilips Electronicsin 1993.Carlyle sold Magnavox for about $370 million toHughes Aircraft Companyin 1995.  Carlyle also invested inVought Aircraftthrough a partnership withNorthrop Grumman.Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition ofUnited Defense Industries.  The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.Carlyle completed an IPO of United Defense on theNew York Stock Exchangein December 2001, then sold the rest of the stock in April 2004.In more recent years, Carlyle has invested less in the defense industry. Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001.  In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported thatShafiq bin Laden, a member of theBin Laden family, had been the \"guest of honor\", and that they were investors in Carlyle-managed funds.Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.These connections would later be profiled inMichael Moore'sFahrenheit 9/11.  The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11 attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic. Buyouts declined after the collapse of thedot-com bubblein 2000 and 2001. But after the two-stage buyout ofDex Mediaat the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain high-yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together withWelsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex,the third-largest corporate buyout since 1989.QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003.R. H. Donnelley Corporationacquired Dex Media in 2006. Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO ofIBMandNabisco, replacedFrank Carluccias chairman of Carlyle in January 2003.Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.The hiring of Gerstner was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier, had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%. Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition ofHawaiian TelcomfromVerizonin May 2004.Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout.  The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems.  Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company. As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors asKKR,Blackstone Group, andTPG Capital.  In 2005, Carlyle, together withClayton, Dubilier & RiceandMerrill Lynchcompleted the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout ofThe Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency fromFord. The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and itsRiverstone Holdingsaffiliate partnered withGoldman Sachs Capital Partnersin the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition ofKinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US.The buyout was backed byRichard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president ofEnron.

In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation – established in August 2006for the purpose of making investments in U.S.mortgage-backed securities– defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by thesubprime mortgage crisisworsened for leveraged investors. TheGuernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expected its creditors to seize its remaining assets.Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to makemargin callsor to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, theFederal Reservegave Wall Street'sprimary dealersthe right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities. On March 12, 2008,BBC News Onlinereported that \"instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset\" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. \"will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets.\"On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition  under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernseyfor a \"compulsory winding up proceeding\" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator. The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be \"minimal from a financial standpoint\". In September 2017, the court ruled that Carlyle had no liability in the lawsuit. Carlyle has been profiled inMichael Moore'sFahrenheit 9/11andWilliam Karel'sThe World According to Bush. InFahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.Moore focused on Carlyle's connections withGeorge H. W. Bushand his Secretary of StateJames Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes authorDan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group \"gained\" from theSeptember 11 attacksbecause it owned military contractorUnited Defense.A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several otherprivate equity firms. InThe World According to Bush,William KarelinterviewedFrank Carluccito discuss the presence ofShafiq bin Laden,Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.",

    "text": " Apollo Global Management, Inc.is an Americanasset management firmthat primarily invests inalternative assets.As of 2025, the company had $840 billion of assets under management, including $392 billion invested in credit, includingmezzanine capital,hedge funds,non-performing loans, andcollateralized loan obligations, $99 billion invested inprivate equity, and $46.2 billion invested in real assets, which includesreal estateandinfrastructure. The company invests money on behalf ofpension funds,financial endowments, andsovereign wealth funds, as well as other institutional and individual investors. Apollo was founded in 1990 byLeon Black,Josh Harris, andMarc Rowan, former investment bankers at the defunctDrexel Burnham Lambert. The company is headquartered in theSolow BuildinginNew York City,with offices across North America, Europe, and Asia.Founder and CEO Leon Black resigned as CEO in 2021 in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations and revelations that he had paid $158 million toJeffrey Epstein. In addition to its private funds, Apollo operates Apollo Investment Corporation (AIC), a US-domiciledpublicly traded, private-equity,closed-end fundandBusiness Development Company. AIC providesmezzanine debt, seniorsecured loans, and equity investments tomiddle-market companies, including public companies, although it historically has not invested in companies controlled by Apollo's private-equity funds. In June 2024, Apollo Global Management ranked 29th inPrivate Equity International'sPEI 300 ranking among the world's largest private equity firms. Apollo, originally referred to as Apollo Advisors, was founded after the collapse ofDrexel Burnham Lambertin 1990 byLeon Black, the former head of Drexel's mergers and acquisitions department, along withJosh HarrisandMarc Rowan.Tony Ressler, another former senior Drexel executive, was also among the firm's original members. Within six months after the collapse of Drexel, Apollo launched Apollo Investment Fund L.P., the first of its private-equity investment funds, formed to make investments in distressed companies. Apollo raised around $400 million of investor commitments based on Leon Black's reputation as a prominent lieutenant ofMichael Milkenand a key player in thebuyout boom of the 1980s. Lion Advisors (or Lion Capital) was founded in 1990 to provide investment services to Credit Lyonnais and foreign institutions, seeking to profit from depressed prices in the high-yield market.In 1992, Lion entered into a more formal arrangement to manage the $3 billion high-yield portfolio for Credit Lyonnais which together with a consortium of other international investors provided the capital for Lion's investment activities. Lion Advisors was replaced byAres Management. At the time of Apollo's founding, little financing was available for newleveraged buyoutsand Apollo turned, instead, to a strategy of distressed-to-control takeovers.Apollo purchaseddistressed securities, which could be converted into a controlling interest in the equity of the company through a bankruptcy reorganization or other restructuring. Apollo used distressed debt as an entry point, enabling the firm to invest in such firms asVail Resorts,Walter Industries,Culligan, andSamsonite. Apollo acquired interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasinghigh-yield bondsfrom failedsavings and loansand insurance companies. Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from the U.S. government'sResolution Trust Corporation.One of Apollo's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company's bond portfolio. Using this vehicle, Apollo purchased the Executive Life portfolio, profiting when the value of high-yield bonds recovered, but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase. In 1993, Apollo Real Estate Advisers was founded in collaboration with William Mack to seek opportunities in the U.S. property markets. In April 1993, Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund, L.P., the first in a family of real estate \"opportunity funds\", was closed with $500 million of investor commitments. In 2000, Apollo exited the partnership, which continued to operate as Apollo Real Estate Advisers until changing its name to AREA Property Partners effective January 15, 2009. That firm was then owned and controlled by its remaining principals, including William Mack, Lee Neibart, William Benjamin, John Jacobsson, Stuart Koenig, and Richard Mack. In 1995, Apollo raised its third private-equity fund, Apollo Investment Fund III, with $1.5 billion of investor commitments from investors that includedCalPERSand theGeneral Motorspension fund.Fund III was only an average performer for private-equity funds of its vintage. Among the investments made in Fund III (invested through 1998) were: Alliance Imaging,Allied Waste Industries,Breuners Home Furnishings,Levitz Furniture,Communications Corporation of America,Dominick's,Ralphs(acquired Apollo'sFood-4-Less),Move.com,NRT Incorporated,Pillowtex Corporation,Telemundo,andWMC Mortgage Corporation. Also in 1995, Apollo's founding partner Craig Cogut left the firm to found Pegasus Capital Advisors. Since its inception, Pegasus has raised $1.8 billion in four private-equity funds focused on investments inmiddle-market companiesin financial distress. In 1997,Ares Managementwas founded by Antony Ressler and John H. Kissick, both partners at Apollo, as well as Bennett Rosenthal, who joined the group from the global leveraged finance group atMerrill Lynch, to manage a $1.2 billion market valuecollateralized debt obligation vehicle.Ares I and II which were raised were structured asmarket value CLOs. Ares III-Ares X were structured ascash flow CLOs. In 2002, Ares completed acorporate spin-offfrom Apollo management. Although technically the founders of Ares had completed a spinout with the formation of the firm in 1997, they had maintained a close relationship with Apollo over its first five years and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo. Shortly thereafter, Ares completed fundraising for Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund, a special-situations investment fund with $750 million of capital under management. In 1998, during thedot-com bubble, Apollo raised Apollo Investment Fund IV with $3.6 billion of investor commitments.

Although the founders of Ares had completed acorporate spin-offwith the formation of the firm in 1997, they had initially maintained a close relationship with Apollo and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo.. In 2002, when Ares raised its first corporate opportunities fund, the firm announced that it would separate from its former parent company.

Bain Capital invests across a range of industry sectors and geographic regions.The firm was founded in 1984 by partners from the consulting firmBain & Company.The company is headquartered at200 Clarendon Streetin Boston with 24 offices in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Since its establishment, Bain Capital has invested in or acquired hundreds of companies, includingAMC Theatres,Artisan Entertainment,Aspen Education Group,Apex Tool Group,Brookstone,Burger King,Burlington Coat Factory,Canada Goose,DIC Entertainment,Domino's Pizza,DoubleClick,Dunkin' Donuts,D&M Holdings,Guitar Center,Hospital Corporation of America (HCA),iHeartMedia,ITP Aero,KB Toys,Sealy,Sports Authority,Staples,Toys \"R\" Us,Virgin Australia,Virgin Voyages,Warner Music Group,Fingerhut,Athenahealth,The Weather Channel,Varsity BrandsandApple Leisure Group, which includes AMResorts and Apple Vacations.The company and its actions during its first 15 years became the subject of political and media scrutiny as a result of co-founderMitt Romney's later political career, especiallyhis 2012 presidential campaign. In June 2023, Bain Capital was ranked 13th inPrivate Equity International's PEI 300 ranking of the largest private equity firms in the world. Bain Capital was founded in 1984 byBain & CompanypartnersMitt Romney, T. Coleman Andrews III, andEric Kriss, afterBill Bainhad offered Romney the chance to head a new venture that would invest in companies and apply Bain's consulting techniques to improve operations.In addition to the three founding partners, the early team includedFraser Bullock,Robert F. White,Joshua Bekenstein, Adam Kirsch, and Geoffrey S. Rehnert.Romney initially held the titles of presidentand managing general partneror managing partner.He later became referred to as managing directoror CEOas well. He was also the sole shareholder of the firm.At the time, the firm had fewer than ten employees. In the face of skepticism from potential investors, Romney and his partners spent a year raising the $37 million in funds needed to start the new operation.Bain partners put in $12 million of their own money and sourced the rest from wealthy individuals.Early investors included Boston real estate mogulMortimer ZuckermanandRobert Kraft, the owner of theNew England Patriots football team.They also included members of elite Salvadoran families such asRicardo Pomawhose capital fled the country'scivil war.They and other wealthy Latin Americans invested $9 million primarily throughoffshore companiesregistered inPanama. While Bain Capital was founded by Bain executives, the firm was not an affiliate or a division of Bain & Company but rather a completely separate company. Initially, the two firms shared the same offices—in an office tower atCopley Placein Boston—and a similar approach to improving business operations. However, the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the Bain & Company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest.Bain Capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of Bain & Company. The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain & Company, but Romney later persuaded Bill Bain to give that up. The Bain Capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital. By 1985, things were going poorly enough that Romney considered closing the operation, returning investors' money to them, and having the partners go back to their old positions.The partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by 1986, very few had been done. At first, Bain Capital focused onventure capitalopportunities.One of Bain's earliest and most notable venture investments was inStaples, Inc., theoffice supplyretailer. In 1986, Bain provided $4.5 million to two supermarket executives, Leo Kahn andThomas G. Stemberg, to open an office supply supermarket inBrighton, Massachusetts.The fast-growing retail chain went public in 1989;by 1996, the company had grown to over 1,100 stores,and as of fiscal year-end January 2012, Staples reached over $20 billion in sales, nearly $1.0B in net income, 87,000 employees, and 2,295 stores.Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade.Another very successful investment occurred in 1986 when $1 million was invested in medical equipment maker Calumet Coach, which eventually returned $34 million.A few years later, Bain Capital made an investment in the technology research outfit theGartner Group, which ended up returning a 16-fold gain. Bain invested the $37 million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by 1989 was generating an annualized return in excess of 50 percent. By the end of the decade, Bain's second fund, raised in 1987 had deployed $106 million into 13 investments.As the firm began organizing around funds, each such fund was run by a specific general partnership—that included all Bain Capital executives as well as others—which in turn was controlled by Bain Capital Inc., the management company that Romney had full ownership control of.As CEO, Romney had a final say in every deal made. In the 1990s, Bain Capital started several affiliates that supported its private equity and other assets classes. The long-short equity hedge fund, Brookside Capital, was founded in 1996 and, Sankaty Advisors, the company's fixed income affiliate, was started two years later.Building affiliates for the firm was directed by three conditions: that it leveraged its core skills; one of its Managing Directors has a leadership role; and, the new business invests in attractive asset class. Beginning in 1989, the firm, which began as aventure capitalsource investing instart-up companies, adjusted its strategy to focus onleveraged buyoutsandgrowth capitalinvestments in more mature companies.Their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets, partner with existing management to apply Bain methodology to their operations (rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios), and sell them off in a few years.Existing CEOs were offered large equity stakes in the process, owing to Bain Capital's belief in the emergingagency theorythat CEOs should be bound to maximizingshareholder valuerather than other goals.By the end of 1990, Bain had raised $175 million of capital and financed 35 companies with combined revenues of $3.5 billion. In July 1992, Bain acquiredAmpad(originally American Pad & Paper) fromMead Corporation, which had acquired the company in 1986. Mead, which had been experiencing difficulties integrating Ampad's products into its existing product lines, generated a cash gain of $56 million on the sale.Under Bain's ownership, the company enjoyed a significant growth in sales from $106.7 million in 1992 to $583.9 million in 1996, when the company was listed on theNew York Stock Exchange. Under Bain's ownership, the company also made a number of acquisitions, including writing products companySCMin July 1994, brand names from the American Trading and Production Corporation in August 1995, WR Acquisition and the Williamhouse-Regency Division of Delaware, Inc. in October 1995, Niagara Envelope Company, Inc. in 1996, and Shade/Allied, Inc. in February 1997.Ampad's revenue began to decline in 1997, and the company laid off employees and closed production facilities to maintain profitability. Employment declined from 4,105 in 1996 to 3,800 in 2000.The company ceased trading on the New York stock exchange on December 22, 2000,and filed for bankruptcy in 2001. At the time of the bankruptcy, Bain Capital held a 34.9% equity ownership interest in the company.The assets were acquired in 2003 byCrescent Investments. Bain's eight years' of involvement in Ampad is estimated to have generated over $100 million in profits ($60 million in dividends, $45–50 million from the proceeds from stock issued after the company went public, and $1.5-2 million in annual management fees). In 1994, Bain acquiredTotes, a producer of umbrellas and overshoes.Three years later, Totes, under Bain's ownership, acquired Isotoner, a producer of leather gloves. Bain, together withThomas H. Lee Partners, acquiredExperian, the consumer credit reporting business ofTRW Inc., in 1996 for more than $1 billion. Formerly known as TRW's Information Systems and Services unit, Experian is one of the leading providers of credit reports on consumers and businesses in the US.The company was sold toGreat Universal Storesfor $1.7 billion just months after being acquired.Other notable Bain investments of the late 1990s, includedSealy Corporation, the manufacturer of mattresses;Alliance Laundry Systems;Domino's Pizzaand Artisan Entertainment. Much of the firm's profits was earned from a relatively small number of deals, with Bain Capital's overall success and failure rate being about even. One study of 68 deals that Bain Capital made up through the 1990s found that the firm lost money or broke even on 33 of them.Another study that looked at the eight-year period following 77 deals during the same time found that in 17 cases the company went bankrupt or out of business, and in 6 cases Bain Capital lost all its investment. But 10 deals were very successful and represented 70 percent of the total profits. Romney had two diversions from Bain Capital during the first half of the decade. From January 1991 to December 1992,Romney was the CEO ofBain & Companywhere he led the successful turnaround of the consulting firm (he remained managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time).In November 1993, he took a leave of absence for his unsuccessful1994 run for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts; he returned the day after the election in November 1994.During that time, Ampad workers went on strike, and asked Romney to intervene; Bain Capital lawyers asked him not to get involved, although he did meet with the workers to tell them he had no position of active authority in the matter. In 1994, Bain invested inSteel Dynamics, based inFort Wayne, Indiana, a prosperous steel company that has grown to the fifth largest in the US, employs about 6,100 people, and produces carbon steel products with 2010 revenues of $6.3 billion on steel shipments of 5.3 million tons.In 1993, Bain acquired theArmco Worldwide Grinding Systemsteel plant inKansas City, Missouriand merged it with its steel plant inGeorgetown, South Carolinato formGST Steel. The Kansas City plant had a strike in 1997 and Bain closed the plant in 2001, laying off 750 workers when it went into bankruptcy. TheSouth Carolinaplant closed in 2003 but subsequently reopened under a different owner. At the time of its bankruptcy it reported $553.9 million in debts against $395.2 in assets. Bain reported $58.4 million in profits, the employee pension fund had a liability of $44 million. Bain's investment inDade Behringrepresented a significant investment in themedical diagnosticsindustry. In 1994, Bain, together withGoldman Sachs Capital Partnerscompleted a carveout acquisition of Dade International,the medical diagnostics division ofBaxter Internationalin a $440 million acquisition. Dade's private equity owners merged the company with DuPont'sin vitrodiagnostics business in May 1996 and subsequently with the Behring Diagnostics division ofHoechst AGin 1997.Aventis, the successor of Hoechst, acquired 52% of the combined company.In 1999, the company reported $1.3 billion of revenue and completed a $1.25 billionleveraged recapitalizationthat resulted in a payout to shareholders.The dividend, taken together with other previous shareholder dividends resulted in an eightfold return on investment to Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs.Revenues declined from 1999 through 2002 and despite attempts to cut costs through layoffs the company entered into bankruptcy in 2002. Following its restructuring, Dade Behring emerged from Bankruptcy in 2003 and continued to operate independently until 2007 when the business was acquired bySiemens Medical Solutions. Bain and Goldman lost their remaining stock in the company as part of the bankruptcy. By the end of the decade, Bain Capital was on its way to being one of the top private equity firms in the nation,having increased its number of partners from 5 to 18, having 115 employees overall, and having $4 billion under its management.The firm's average annual return on investments was 113 percent.It had made between 100 and 150 deals where it acquired and then sold a company. Romney took a paid leave of absence from Bain Capital in February 1999, when he became the head of theSalt Lake Organizing Committeefor the2002 Winter Olympics.The decision caused turmoil at Bain Capital, with a power struggle ensuing.Some partners left and founded the Audax Group andGolden Gate Capital.Other partners threatened to leave, and there was a prospect of eight-figure lawsuits being filed.Romney was worried that the firm might be destroyed, but the crisis ebbed. Romney was not involved in day-to-day operations of the firm after starting the Olympics position.Those were handled by a management committee, consisting of five of the fourteen remaining active partners with the firm.However, according to some interviews and press releases during 1999, Romney said he was keeping a part-time function at Bain. During his leave of absence, Romney continued to be listed in filings to theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionas \"sole shareholder, sole director, Chief Executive Officer and President\".The SEC filings reflected the legal realityand the ownership interest in the Bain Capital management company.In practice, former Bain partners have stated that Romney's attention was mostly occupied by his Olympics position.He did stay in regular contact with his partners, and traveled to meet with them several times, signing corporate and legal documents and paying attention to his own interests within the firm and to his departure negotiations.Bain Capital Fund VI in 1998 was the last one Romney was involved in; investors were worried that with Romney gone, the firm would have trouble raising money for Bain Capital Fund VII in 2000, but in practice the $2.5 billion was raised without much trouble.His former partners have said that Romney had no role in assessing other new investments after February 1999,nor was he involved in directing the company's investment funds.Discussions over the final terms of Romney's departure dragged on during this time, with Romney negotiating for the best deal he could get and his continuing position as CEO and sole shareholder giving him the leverage to do so. Although he had left open the possibility of returning to Bain after the Olympics, Romney made his crossover to politics in 1999.His separation from the firm was finalized in early 2002.Romney negotiated a ten-year retirement agreement with Bain Capitalthat allowed him to receive a passive profit share and interest as a retired partner in some Bain Capital entities, including buyout and Bain Capital investment funds, in exchange for his ownership in the management company.Because the private equity business continued to thrive, this deal would bring him millions of dollars in annual income.Romney was the first and last CEO of Bain Capital; since his departure became final, it has continued to be run by management committee. Bain Capital itself, and especially its actions and investments during its first 15 years, came under press scrutiny as the result of Romney's2008and2012 presidential campaigns,including accusations ofAsset Stripping.Romney's leave of absence and the level of activity he had within the firm during the 1999-2002 period also garnered attention. In 2000,DIC Entertainmentchairman and CEOAndy Heywardpartnered with Bain Capital Inc in a management buyout of DIC fromThe Walt Disney Company.Heyward continued as chairman and CEO of the animation studio, which has more than 2,500 half-hours of programming in its library. He purchased Bain Capital's interest in 2004 and took the company public the following year. Bain Capital began the new decade by closing on its seventh fund, Bain Capital Fund VII, with over $3.1 billion of investor commitments. The firm's most notable investments in 2000 included the $700 million acquisition of Datek, sold toTD Ameritradein 2002,as well as the $305 million acquisition ofKB ToysfromConsolidated Stores.KB Toys, which had been financially troubled since the 1990s as a result of increased pressure from national discount chains such asWalmartandTarget, filed forChapter 11bankruptcy protection in January 2004. Bain had been able to recover value on its investment through adividend recapitalizationin 2003.In early 2001, Bain agreed to purchase a 30 percent stake, worth $600 million, inHuntsman Corporation, a leading chemical company owned byJon Huntsman, Sr., but the deal was never completed. With a significant amount of committed capital in its new fund available for investment, Bain was one of a handful of private equity investors capable of completing large transactions in the adverse conditions of theearly 2000s recession. In July 2002, Bain together withTPG CapitalandGoldman Sachs Capital Partners, announced the high-profile $2.3 billion leveraged buyout ofBurger KingfromDiageo.However, in November the original transaction collapsed when Burger King failed to meet certain performance targets. In December 2002, Bain and its co-investors agreed on a reduced $1.5 billion purchase price for the investment.The Bain consortium had support from Burger King's franchisees, who controlled approximately 92% of Burger King restaurants at the time of the transaction. Under its new owners,Burger Kingunderwent a major brand overhaul including the use ofThe Burger Kingcharacter in advertising. In February 2006, Burger King announced plans for aninitial public offering. In late 2002, Bain remained active acquiringHoughton Mifflinfor $1.28 billion, together withThomas H. Lee PartnersandBlackstone Group. Houghton Mifflin and Burger King represented two of the first largeclub deals, completed since the collapse of theDot-com bubble. In November 2003, Bain completed an investment inWarner Music Groupthrough an acquisition by Edgar Bronfman Jr.In 2004 Bain acquired theDollaramachain ofdollar stores, based inMontreal,Quebec, Canada and operating stores in the provinces ofEastern Canadafor $1.05 billionCAD. In March 2004, Bain acquired Brenntag Group from Deutsche Bahn AG (Exited in 2006; sold toBC Partnersfor $4B). In August 2003, Bain acquired a 50% interest inBombardier Inc.'s recreational products division, along with the Bombardier family and theCaisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, and createdBombardier Recreational Productsor BRP. In 2004 aconsortiumcomprising KKR, Bain Capital, and real estate development companyVornado Realty Trustannounced the $6.6 billion acquisition ofToys \"R\" Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier,Cerberus Capital Management, made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses.The Toys 'R' Us buyout was one of the largest in several years.Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts. The following year, in 2005, Bain was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout ofSunGardin a transaction valued at $11.3 billion.Bain's partners in the acquisition wereSilver Lake Partners,TPG Capital,Goldman Sachs Capital Partners,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,Providence Equity Partners, andBlackstone Group. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover ofRJR Nabiscoat the end of the 1980s, leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout ofFreescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largestclub dealcompleted to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive. Bain led a consortium, together withThe Carlyle GroupandThomas H. Lee Partnersto acquireDunkin' Brands. The private equity firms paid $2.425 billion in cash for the parent company ofDunkin' DonutsandBaskin-Robbinsin December 2005. In 2006, Bain Capital andKohlberg Kravis Roberts, together withMerrill Lynchand the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $31.6 billion acquisition ofHospital Corporation of America, 17 years after it was taken private for the first time in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout was the first of several to set new records for the largest buyout, eclipsing the 1989 buyout ofRJR Nabisco. It was later surpassed by the buyouts ofEQ OfficeandTXU.In August 2006, Bain was part of theconsortium, together withKohlberg Kravis Roberts,Silver Lake Partners, andAlpInvest Partners, that acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit ofPhilipsfor €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamedNXP Semiconductors. During the buyout boom, Bain was active in the acquisition of various retail businesses.In January 2006, Bain announced the acquisition ofBurlington Coat Factory, a discount retailer operating 367 department stores in 42 states, in a $2 billion buyout transaction.Six months later, in October 2006, Bain andThe Blackstone GroupacquiredMichaels Stores, the largest arts and crafts retailer in North America in a $6.0 billion leveraged buyout. Bain and Blackstone narrowly beat outKohlberg Kravis RobertsandTPG Capitalin an auction for the company.In June 2007, Bain agreed to acquireHD Supply, the wholesale construction supply business ofHome Depotfor $10.3 billion.Bain, along with partnersCarlyle GroupandClayton, Dubilier & Rice, would later negotiate a lower price ($8.5 billion) when the initial stages of thesubprime mortgage crisiscaused lenders to seek to renegotiate the terms of the acquisition financing.Just days after the announcement of the HD Supply deal, on June 27, Bain announced the acquisition ofGuitar Center, the leading musical equipment retailer in the U.S. Bain paid $1.9 billion, plus $200 million in assumed debt, representing a 26% premium to the stock's closing price prior to the announcement.Bain also acquiredEdcon Limited, which operates Edgars Department Stores inSouth AfricaandZimbabwefor 25 billion rand ($3.5 billion) in February 2007. Other investments during the buyout boom included:Bavaria Yachtbau, acquired for €1.3 billion in July 2007as well as Sensata Technologies, acquired fromTexas Instrumentsin 2006 for approximately $3 billion.It is noted that Bain Capital seldom engages in reinvesting in its own companies that ran into difficulties.This was the case withDade Behring, which was sold after emerging from a bankruptcy.

The revenue potential of this strategy, which may \"starve\" a company of capital,was increased by a 1970s court ruling that allowed companies to consider the entire fair market value of the company, instead of only their \"hard assets\", in determining how much money was available to pay dividends.In at least some instances, companies acquired by Bain borrowed money in order to increase their dividend payments, ultimately leading to the collapse of what had been financially stable businesses.",

SoftBank Corp.(ソフトバンク株式会社,SofutoBanku Kabushikigaisha)is SoftBank's telecommunications subsidiary, providing both mobile and fixed-line services. It was called SoftBank Mobile until July 2015, when the Group merged SoftBank BB Corp., SoftBank Telecom Corp. andYmobile Corporationto reflect its fixed-line and ISP operations. SoftBank's mobile communications arm began with the formation ofJapan Telecomin 1984. The Digital Phone Group (デジタルホン, DPG, three local companies) mobile phone division was formed in 1994, and J-PHONE Co., Ltd. (J-フォン) was formed in 1999 by the DGP/ Digital TU-KA Group merger (DTG, six local companies, not to be confused withTU-KA). Japan Telecom owned a stake of 45.1%. J-PHONE grew steadily for a decade by introducing new services and enhancements such as SkyWalker forPDC, SkyMelody ringtone download, theSha-Mailpicture mail introduced followingcamera phonesdeveloped bySHARP, the mobile multimedia data serviceJ-Skymodeled afterNTT DoCoMo'si-mode, and advancedJavaservices based onJSCL, modeled after NTT DoCoMo'sDoJabased i-appli. In October 2001, the British mobile phone groupVodafoneincreased its share to 66.7% of Japan Telecom and 69.7% of J-Phone. On 1 October 2003,  the company's name and the service brand changed to Vodafone, while the division was called VodafoneK.K.or Vodafone Japan. However, in January 2005, Vodafone Japan lost 58,700 customers and in February 2005 lost 53,200 customers, while competitors NTT DoCoMo gained 184,400 customers, whileAu by KDDIgained 163,700, andWillcomgained 35,000. While as of February 2005, DoCoMo'sFOMA3G service had attracted 10 million subscribers and KDDI's 3G service had attracted over 17 million subscribers, Vodafone's 3G service only attracted 527,300 subscribers. Vodafone 3G failed to attract subscribers because Vodafone reduced investments in 3G services in Japan in 2002/3; handsets did not fully match the needs and preferences of Japanese customers. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone Japan had 15.1 million customers. By the end of October 2005, the number of subscribers had fallen below 15M. During the same period, NTT DoCoMo gained 1.65 million customers, and KDDI/AU gained 1.82 million customers. Vodafone-Japan had only 4.8% of Japan's 3G market. Vodafone changed the name of its multimedia data services from J-Sky toVodafone live!and used J-Sky's principles, technologies, and business models to introduce theWAP-based Vodafone live! in Vodafone's other markets. At the end of February 2005, Vodafone live! had 12.907 million subscribers in Japan. By the end of October 2005, the number of Vodafone live! subscribers had fallen by 138,000. In March 2006, Vodafone began discussing the sale of the Vodafone Japan unit to SoftBank. Vodafone was unable to satisfy customers. Handsets had user interfaces that differed too much from the Japanese interface and lacked competitive features. On 17 March 2006, Vodafone Group announced it had agreed to sell Vodafone Japan to SoftBank for about US$15.1 billion. On 18 May 2006, the unit was renamed \"SoftBank Mobile Corp.\", effective 1 October 2006. On 4 June 2008, SoftBank Mobile announced a partnership withAppleand brought theiPhone (3G)to Japan later in 2008.SoftBank Mobile was the only official carrier of theiPhonein Japan until the release ofiPhone 4Sin 2011, whenau by KDDIbegan to offer it. SoftBank Corp.'s mobile network operatesW-CDMA(UMTS3G) network (\"SoftBank 3G\"). SoftBank's 3G network is compatible withUMTSand supports transparent global roaming for UMTS subscribers from other countries. Since May 2006, SoftBank's telecommunications marketing and commercials have principally revolved around \"Otosan\", the caninepatriarchof the otherwise human \"Shirato\" family.\"Otosan\" translates to father, and the character, aHokkaido dog, indeed acts as the father of the family, along with the son \"Kojiro\" (starred byDante Carver), mom \"Masako\" (Kanako Higuchi), and daughter \"Aya\" (Aya Ueto).The advertising series proved to be popular: CM Research Center ranked the Otousan adverts as the most popular in Japan between 2007 and 2012, based on monthly surveys of 3,000 randomly selected adults. SoftBank partnered with theIngressaugmented reality game, supporting the branded \"SoftBank Ultra Link\" in-gameitem. SoftBank bought a \"team\" for theAmerica's Cup. The team was named SoftBank Team Japan, andYanmarcame on board. SoftBank Team Japan raced in the 2017 races held inBermuda. The team members come from various backgrounds, most of whom were not Japanese. The company was the official jersey sponsor of theJapanese national basketball teamat the official2017 Asian Basketball ChampionshipinLebanonas well as the2019 FIBA World Cup. SoftBank has also owned theFukuoka SoftBank Hawks, a Japanese professional baseball team based inFukuoka, since 2005. The SoftBank logo appears on the jersey, and the team has won sevenJapan Serieschampionships under SoftBank, all of which came between2011and2020. In 2015, SoftBank, along with some other companies in Japan,offered a baby bonus for employees who have children. The payments range from 50,000 yen for the first child to 5 million yen for the fifth child. SoftBank Investment Advisers oversees SoftBank's Vision Fund, created in 2017, which invests in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and theinternet of things.It intended to develop a portfolio of 125 AI companies.According to the fund and Son, it also invested in companies to revolutionize real estate, transportation, and retail. Son claimed he would make personal connections with the CEOs of all companies funded by Vision Fund in order to boost synergies among them.Son’s original plans were to raise $100 billion for a new fund every few years, investing about $50 billion a year in startups.By 2023, after the launch of Vision Fund 1 and 2, the dismal performanceof SoftBank’s funds had cast a shadow over the initial exuberance of both Masayoshi Son and his company regarding its huge, largely unprofitable intercorporate investmentsthat had become the main mission, vision and purpose of the entire SoftBank Group. SoftBank Ventures Asia (SBVA) was the globalearly-stageventure capitalarm of the SoftBank GroupThe firm focused on early-stageICTinvestments – includingArtificial Intelligence (AI),the internet of things (IoT), andsmart robotics.By October 2021, SBVA had backed more than 250 companies in 10 countries with US$1.3 billion fund under management.

With the company’s extended expertise inICTinvestment, SBVA is aiming towards two investment themes, which were ‘technology innovation’ inAI,Robotics, Semiconductor, Mobility, and AR/VR, and ‘market innovation’ in consumer, enterprise, shared economy, healthcare, etc.SBVA created $160M ‘future innovation fund’ in March 2021, focusing on AIstart-upsand made investment in AI sector including VoyagerX, AI software developer,Upstage AI, AI solution provider,and MarqVision, AI-poweredintellectual property (IP)protection platform. In April 2023, it was known that Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group would sell its early-stage venture capital arm SoftBank Ventures Asia to Singapore-based The Edgeof, a newly formed investment firm led by Son's youngest brother,Taizo Son, as SoftBank Group grappled with steep losses in a myriad of investments made around the world.The operation raised governance concerns.",

With over $100 billion in capital, it is the world's largest technology-focusedinvestment fund.In 2019, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 was founded. The Softbank Vision Fund was created in May 2017 by theSoftBank Groupand thePublic Investment Fund(PIF).$100 billion was raised with PIF contributing $45 billion, SoftBank contributing $28 billion, theMubadala Investment Companycontributing $15 billion and the rest from other investors includingApple.Through Softbank Vision Fund,Masayoshi Sonexplained his intent to invest in all companies developing technologies in line with the globalartificial intelligencetrends, including various sectors such as finance or transportation.The project was internally codenamed \"Project Crystal Ball\". As of early February 2019, the Vision Fund had built up a 4.9% position inNvidiastock,and then was forced to sell all those shares when a prolonged plunge in Nvidia's stock price threatened to endanger the fund's overall performance.Over a six-month period, the fund had set up acollarstrategy around its Nvidia stock, thereby protecting itself from a severe price drop which began in October 2018 but also limiting its ability to profit from any rise in Nvidia's stock price.At the time, the Vision Fund recorded a $3.3 billion return on its Nvidia investment.The fund's February 2019 closeout of its Nvidia position preceded theAI boomand Nvidia's rapid transformation into one ofthe world's most valuable companies.By June 2024, the market value of those shares had exceeded $150 billion, causing Son to publicly remark that \"the fish that got away was big\". In January 2020, multiple Softbank-funded startups started cutting their staff, such as atGetaround,Oyo,Rappi,KaterraandZume.In February 2020,Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, bought a $2.5 billion stake in Softbank and pushed for restructuration and more transparency, especially regarding its Vision Fund.With many portfolio companies of the first fund not performing well and high profile debacles such as the buyout ofWeWorkafter its failedInitial public offering, investor confidence in the Vision Fund fell.In May 2020, Softbank announced the Vision Fund lost $18 billion leading to 15% of the fund's 500 staff being laid off.As a result, the Vision Fund 2 raised less than half of its $108 billion goal with all of it being funded by Softbank itself after failure to secure commitments from external investors. In May 2021, SoftBank announced the totalfair valueof both funds as of 31 March 2021 was $154 billion and the Vision Funds made a record profit of $36.99 billion due to its successful investment inCoupang.After announcing the success, SoftBank raised the size of Vision Fund 2 to $30 billion and stated it plans to continue self funding the second fund although it might consider trying again to secure funding from external investors.Also in May 2021, Bloomberg reported that Vision Fund could become public through a $300 millionSPACin 2021, listing inAmsterdam. In 2022, SoftBank Vision Fund posted a record 3.5 trillion yen loss ($27.4 billion) for its financial year ended on 31 March 2022 as the valuation of its stock portfolio plummeted.The fund's losing investments were massive and both Son, who had claimed he had a special ability to see the future ofdisruptiveentrepreneurship, and SoftBank, received much criticism from shareholders, peers and the business and finance media in general due to the magnitude of the failure. Costly failures like those ofKaterra,WirecardandZymergenwere just a few examples of SoftBank's reckless investing behaviour and the investing holding company's incompetence, neglect and failure to showdue diligence. In July 2022, CEORajeev Misraannounced he would be stepping back from some of his main roles including the management of SoftBank Vision Fund 2.Several other executives stepped down from their roles in the same year. In August 2022, the Vision fund announced a loss of $23.1 billion for the April–June quarter and that it would be planning to cut headcounts.Eric J. Savitz, associate editor for technology atBarron's, characterized the SoftBank Vision Fund as a failed experiment.Masayoshi Son said at the time he was \"embarrassed\" and \"ashamed\" when he was confronted with SoftBank Vision Fund'sdismal performance andThe Wall Street Journalcalled SoftBank a \"big loser\"whileBloombergelaborated on \"Masayoshi Son’s broken business model.\"Son's investing strategy in the first and second SoftBank Vision Funds established in 2017 and 2019, was being described as one reliant on thegreater fool theoryand the lackluster performance of its investments and Masayoshi Son's presentations in face of that, have been ridiculed by specialized media. By early 2023, having lost its exuberancedue to serious profitability issuesand facing decliningreturn on investmentprospectsas well as record losses,the once world's biggest investor in startups had invested just $300 million into startups in the last October–December quarter, down more than 90% from the previous year.In May 2023, the SoftBank Group disclosed that its Vision Fund lost a record $32 billion in the fiscal year ending in March 2023. In November 2024, Misra formally stepped down from his role in managing the Vision Fund and will be succeeded by Alex Clavel.

Afterwards Sequoia China raised more money, mostly from USinstitutional investorsand built a successful investment record which included companies such asAlibaba Group,JD.com,Meituan,Pinduoduo,SheinandByteDance. Historically 90% of returns came from consumer, consumer tech and healthcare fields. No other US investment manager had same level of success in China as Sequoia China. By 2023, Sequoia China had invested in over 1,000 projects. In 2021, the firm acquired a controlling stake in the French fashion brandAmi Paris. In June 2023, Sequoia announced that it would be splitting off Sequoia China as a separate entity and would be completed by 31 March 2024. This came at a time of rising tensions inChina–United States relationswhere Chinese leaders did not want to see US investors reaping rewards from their companies and US leaders did not want to see money being used to invest in Chinese technology such assemiconductors. However Sequoia denied that rising tensions were the reasons for the split. Sequoia China would be rebranded as HongShan (apinyinromanisationof its Chinese name, which means redwood) in English but its Chinese name remained the same. Going forward, the firm will be raising capital as a Chinese venture capital firm rather than as the Chinese arm of an American venture capital firm. In July 2023, HongShan announced that it had set up an office inSingaporeand was making plans to use it as a base to invest inSoutheast Asia. It was speculated  that it would be competing with Peak XV Partners, the Indian and Southeast Asian investment arm of Sequoia China that was also split off in June 2023. HongShan has stated there are no plans to open an office in the US. In October 2023, theUnited States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Partyasked Sequoia in a letter to provide details about investments inartificial intelligenceand other high-tech sectors made by it and HongShan. Members also questioned Sequoia if its decision to split-off HongShan would insulate some capital flows from US regulatory scrutiny. This was because HongShan relied onlimited partnersto finance deals so the split would not stop US institutional investors from continuing to invest in it. In addition, members also sated HongShan would be likely to scrap thenational securityscreening mechanism that Sequoia had created to evaluate investments by its companies. Members also accused HongShan of funnelling US capital into investments that contributed tohuman rights abusesand military modernisation with examples being DeepGlint and ByteDance. Additional requests included identifying any limited partners domiciled in China or that manage funds forstate-ownedor affiliated entities and to confirm the number of HongShan's limited partners that are US investors. So far US limited partners were not targeted and institutional investors that invest in Hongshan are confident they can continue their relationship with HongShan after theUnited States Department of the Treasuryfinalises restrictions on outbound investment mandated by anexecutive order. In November 2023, it was reported that despite scrutiny from US lawmakers, several new investors signed on with HongShan. They includeCalPERSandUniversity of WashingtonInvestment Management. Existing investors such asCPP Investment BoardandRegents of the University of Californiaadded additional commitments. In July 2024, HongShan raised its first new fund as a separate entity. It raised 18 billion RMB ($2.5 billion) for its new fund to invest in startups. In October 2024, HongShan set up a London office to look for investment opportunities in Europe with plans to make overseas investments. In November 2024, it was reported HongShan was struggling to deploy its large cash pile in a sluggish domestic market and tightening US controls. In 2025, HSG acquired a majority stake in the audio equipment makerMarshall Group.The deal, valued at $1.1 billion, became HSG's largest investment in Europe. HSG opened an office inTokyo,Japanin February 2025. In September 2025, HSG was shortlisted together withEQT,The Carlyle Group, andBoyu Capitalto bid for a controlling stake inStarbucks' China operations. In October 2025,Bayer AGwas reported to be selling its globalAveloxantibiotics business to HSG. In December 2025, HSG acquired a majority stake in Italian luxury fashion companyGolden Goose.",

    "text": " Social capitalis a concept used insociologyandeconomicsto define networks of relationships which are productive towards advancing the goals of individuals and groups.It involves the effective functioning ofsocial groupsthroughinterpersonal relationships, a shared sense ofidentity, a shared understanding, sharednorms, sharedvalues,trust,cooperation, andreciprocity. Some have described it as a form of capital that producespublic goodsfor acommon purpose, although this does not align with how it has been measured. Social capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived fromstrategic alliances, and the evolution ofcommunities. While it has been suggested that the termsocial capitalwas in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s,the earliest credited use is byLyda Hanifanin 1916 (see 20th century below). The debate of community versusmodernizationof society andindividualismhas been the most discussed topic among the founders ofsociology: such theorists asTönnies(1887),Durkheim(1893),Simmel(1905),Weber(1946)were convinced thatindustrialisationandurbanizationwere transforming social relationships in an irreversible way. They observed a breakdown of traditional bonds and the progressive development ofanomieandalienationin society. The power ofcommunity governancehas been stressed by many philosophers from antiquity to the 18th century, fromAristotletoThomas Aquinas, andEdmund Burke.This vision was strongly criticised at the end of the 18th century, with the development of the idea ofHomo Economicusand subsequently withrational choice theory. Such a set of theories became dominant in the last centuries, but many thinkers questioned the complicated relationship betweenmodern societyand the importance ofold institutions, in particular family and traditional communities. The concept that underlies social capital has a much longer history; thinkers exploring the relation between associational life and democracy were using similar concepts regularly by the 19th century, drawing on the work of earlier writers such asJames Madison(The Federalist Papers) andAlexis de Tocqueville(Democracy in America) to integrate concepts of social cohesion andconnectednessinto thepluralisttradition inAmerican political science.John Deweymay have made the first direct mainstream use ofsocial capitalinThe School and Societyin 1899, though he did not offer a definition. In the first half of the 19th century, de Tocqueville had observations about American life that seemed to outline and define social capital. He observed that Americans were prone to meeting at as many gatherings as possible to discuss all possible issues of state, economics, or the world that could be witnessed. The high levels of transparency caused greater participation from the people and thus allowed for democracy to work better. L. J. Hanifan's 1916 article regarding local support for rural schools is one of the first occurrences of the termsocial capitalin reference to social cohesion and personal investment in the community.In defining the concept, Hanifan contrasts social capital with material goods by defining it as: I do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit.… If he may come into contact with his neighbour, and they with other neighbours, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbours. Following the works ofTönnies(1887)andWeber(1946),reflection on social links in modern society continued with interesting contributions in the 1950s and in the 1960s. In particular,mass society theory– as developed byDaniel Bell(1962),Robert Nisbet(1969),Maurice R. Stein(1960),William H. Whyte(1956)– proposed themes similar to those of the founders, with a more pessimistic emphasis on the development of society. In the words of Stein (1960:1): \"The price for maintaining a society that encourages cultural differentiation and experimentation is unquestionably the acceptance of a certain amount of disorganization on both the individual and social level.\" Jane Jacobsused the term early in the 1960s. Although she did not explicitly define the termsocial capital, her usage referred to the value of networks.Political scientistRobert Salisbury advanced the term as a critical component of interest group formation in his 1969 article \"An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups\" in theMidwest Journal of Political Science. SociologistPierre Bourdieuused the term in 1972 in hisOutline of a Theory of Practice,and clarified the term some years later in contrast tocultural,economic, administrative capital,physical capital,political capital, social capital andsymbolic capital.SociologistsJames Coleman(1988),as well asBarry Wellman& Scot Wortley (1990),adoptedGlenn Loury's 1977 definition in developing and popularising the concept.In the late 1990s, the concept gained popularity, serving as the focus of aWorld Bankresearch programmeand the subject of several mainstream books, includingRobert Putnam'sBowling Alone,and Putnam &Lewis Feldstein'sBetter Together. All of these reflections contributed remarkably to the development of the social capital concept in the following decades. The appearance of the modern social capital conceptualization is a new way to look at this debate, keeping together the importance of community to build generalized trust and the same time, the importance of individual free choice, in order to create a more cohesive society. It is for this reason that social capital generated so much interest in the academic and political world. Social capital has multiple definitions, interpretations, and uses. David Halpern argues that the popularity of social capital forpolicymakersis linked to the concept's duality, coming because \"it has a hard nosed economic feel while restating the importance of the social.\" For researchers, the term is popular partly due to the broad range of outcomes it can explain;the multiplicity of uses for social capital has led to a multiplicity of definitions. Social capital has been used at various times to explain superior managerial performance,the growth of entrepreneurial firms,improved performance of functionally diverse groups,the value derived from strategic alliances,and enhanced supply-chain relations.\"A resource that actors derive from specific social structures and then use to pursue their interests; it is created by changes in the relationship among actors\" (Baker 1990, p. 619). Early attempts to define social capital focused on the degree to which social capital serves as a resource – be it for public good or private benefit.Robert D. Putnam(1993) suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast, others focus on the private benefits derived from the web of social relationships in which individual actors find themselves.This is reflected inNan Lin's concept of social capital as \"Investment in social relations with expected returns in the marketplace.\" This may subsume the concepts of some others such as Bourdieu, Flap and Eriksson.Newton (1997)treats social capital as a subjective phenomenon formed by values and attitudes that influence interactions. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), in their examination of the role of social capital in the creation ofintellectual capital, suggest that social capital should be considered in terms of three clusters: structural, relational, and cognitive. A number of scholars have raised concerns about the imprecision in defining social capital. Portes (2000), for example, notes that the term has become so widely used, including inmainstream media, that \"the point is approaching at which social capital comes to be applied to so many events and in so many different contexts as to lose any distinct meaning.\"The termcapitalis used byanalogywith other forms ofeconomic capital, as social capital is argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits. However, the analogy may be misleading in that, unlike financial forms of capital, social capital is not depleted by use;instead, it is depleted by non-use (use it or lose it). In this respect, it is similar to the economic concept ofhuman capital. Robison, Schmid, and Siles (2002) review various definitions of social capital and conclude that many do not satisfy the formal requirements of a definition.They assert that definitions must be of the form A=B, while many explanations of social capital describe what it can be used to achieve, where it resides, how it can be created, or what it can transform. In addition, they argue that many proposed definitions of social capital fail to satisfy the requirements of capital. They propose that social capital be defined assympathy: the object of another's sympathy has social capital; those who have sympathy for others provide social capital.This proposition appears to followAdam Smith,Theory of Moral Sentimentsto some degree, but Smith's conceptualization of sympathy (particularly in the first two chapters of this work) appear more concerned with the roles of acceptance or congruence – in ethics or virtue – in evaluating an individual's 'propriety of action'. Social capitalis different from the economic theory ofsocial capitalism, which challenges the idea thatsocialismandcapitalismare mutually exclusive. InThe Forms of Capital,Pierre Bourdieudistinguishes between three forms of capital:economic capital,cultural capitaland social capital.He definessocial capitalas \"the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.\"His treatment of the concept is instrumental, focusing on the advantages to possessors of social capital and the\"deliberate construction of sociability for the purpose of creating this resource.\"Quite contrary to Putnam's positive view of social capital, Bourdieu employs the concept to demonstrate a mechanism for the generational reproduction of inequality. Bourdieu thus points out that the wealthy and powerful use their \"old boys network\" or other social capital to maintain advantages for themselves, their social class, and their children. Thomas Sanderdefines it as \"the collectivevalueof allsocial networks(who people know), and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (normsofreciprocity).\"Social capital, in this view, emphasizes \"specificbenefitsthat flow from thetrust,reciprocity,information, andcooperationassociated with social networks.\" It \"creates value for the people who are connected, and forbystandersas well.\"Meanwhile, negative norms of reciprocity serve as disincentives for detrimental and violent behaviors. James Colemandefined social capital functionally as \"a variety of entities with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of actors...within the structure\"– that is, social capital is anything that facilitates individual orcollective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms.In Coleman's conception, social capital is a neutral resource that facilitates any manner of action, but whether society is better off as a result depends entirely on the individual uses to which it is put. According toRobert D. Putnam,social capitalrefers to \"connections among individuals – social networks and the norms ofreciprocityandtrustworthinessthat arise from them.\"In the view of Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintainingdemocracy. Putnam says that social capital is declining in the United States. This is seen in lower levels of trust in government and lower levels of civic participation. Putnam also suggests that a root cause of the decline in social capital iswomen's entry into the workforce, which could correlate with time restraints that inhibit civic organizational involvement likeparent-teacher associations.Technological transformation ofleisure(e.g., television) is another cause of declining social capital, as stated by Putnam. This offered a reference point from which several studies assessed social capital measurements by how media is engaged strategically to build social capital. In \"Social Capital, Civil Society, and Development\", political economistFrancis Fukuyamadefines social capital as generally understood rules that enable people to cooperate such as the norm ofreciprocityorreligious doctrinelikeChristianity. Social capital is formed by repeated interactions over time and, he argues, is critical for development and difficult to generate through public policy. The importance of social capital for economic development is that these norms of behavior reducetransaction costof exchange such as legal contracts and government regulations. Fukuyama suggests that while social capital is beneficial for development, it also imposes cost on non-group members with unintended consequences for general welfare. ReferencingAlexis de TocquevilleinDemocracy in America,and what he described as theart of associationof the American propensity forcivil association, Fukuyama argues social capital is what produces acivil society. While civic engagement is an important part of democracy and development, Fukuyama states that, \"one person's civic engagement is another'srent-seeking.\" Therefore, while social capital can facilitate economic development by reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity, social capital can also distort democracy if civic association enables special interest to gain special favors. However, Fukuyama argues despite the risk of society having too much social capital, it is nonetheless worse to have too little and be unable to organize for public goods and welfare enhancing activity. Carlos García Timóndescribes that the structural dimensions of social capital relate to an individual ability to make weak and strong ties to others within a system. This dimension focuses on the advantages derived from the configuration of an actor's, either individual or collective, network.The differences betweenweakandstrongties are explained by Granovetter (1973).Bridging social capital refers to the weak ties that individuals with heterogeneous limited interactions form. Bridging social capital is more likely to provide valuable new information (Moshkovitz and Hayat, 2021). Some others describes the weak and strong ties relationship as bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital refers to strong ties: the intimate relationships people feel close to and trust. The relational dimension focuses on the character of the connection between individuals. This is best characterized through trust of others and their cooperation and the identification an individual has within a network.Hazleton and Kennan (2000)added a third angle, that of communication. Communication is needed to access and use social capital through exchanging information, identifying problems and solutions, and managing conflict. According toBoisot(1995),and Boland & Tenkasi (1995),meaningful communication requires at least some sharing context between the parties to such exchange. The cognitive dimension focuses on the shared meaning, representations and interpretations that individuals or groups have with one another. Whereas some scholars, most prominentlyRobert D. Putnam, posit that social capital has positive ends,a sizable body of literature finds that social capital can have adverse effects. Research bySheri Bermanand Dylan Riley, as well as economists Shanker Satyanath, Nico Voigtländer, and Hans-Joachim Voth, have linked civic associations to the rise of fascist movements.Pierre Bourdieu's work tends to show how social capital can be used practically to produce or reproduce inequality, demonstrating for instance how people gain access to powerful positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections. An example of the complexities of the negative of effects social capital is violence or criminalgangactivity that is encouraged through the strengthening of intra-group relationships (bonding social capital).The negative consequences of social capital are more often associated withbondingvis-à-visbridging. Without \"bridging\" social capital, \"bonding\" groups can become isolated anddisenfranchisedfrom the rest of society and, most importantly, from groups with which bridging must occur in order to denote an \"increase\" in social capital. Bonding social capital is a necessary antecedent for the development of the more powerful form of bridging social capital.Bonding and bridging social capital can work together productively if in balance, or they may work against each other. As social capital bonds and stronger homogeneous groups form, the likelihood of bridging social capital is attenuated. Bonding social capital can also perpetuate sentiments of a certain group, allowing for the bonding of certain individuals together upon a common radical ideal. The strengthening of insular ties can lead to a variety of effects such as ethnic marginalization or social isolation. In extreme cases ethnic cleansing may result if the relationship between different groups is so strongly negative. In mild cases, it  isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the bonding social capital and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital. Edwards and Foley, as editors of a special edition of theAmerican Behavioral Scientiston \"Social Capital, Civil Society and Contemporary Democracy\", raised two key issues in the study of social capital. First, social capital is not equally available to all, in much the same way that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic andsocial isolationlimit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society. On top of this, Portes (1998) has identified four negative consequences of social capital: Social capital (in the institutionalRobert Putnamsense) may also lead to bad outcomes if thepolitical institutionanddemocracyin a specific country is not strong enough and is therefore overpowered by the social capital groups. \"Civil society and the collapse of theWeimar Republic\" suggests that \"it was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem during theWihelmineand Weimar eras.\"Because the political institutions were so weak people looked to other outlets. \"Germans threw themselves into their clubs, voluntary associations, and professional organizations out of frustration with the failures of the national government and political parties, thereby helping to undermine the Weimar Republic and facilitateHitler's rise to power.\" In this article about the fall of theWeimar Republic, the author makes the claim that Hitler rose to power so quickly because he was able to mobilize the groups towards one common goal. Even though German society was, at the time, a \"joining\" society these groups were fragmented and their members did not use the skills they learned in their club associations to better their society, but to encourage their values across all cultures to provide a better society for people. They were very introverted in the Weimar Republic. Hitler was able to capitalize on this by uniting these highly bonded groups under the common cause of bringing Germany to the top of world politics. The former world order had been destroyed duringWorld War I, and Hitler believed that Germany had the right and the will to become a dominant global power. Additionally, in his essay \"A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital\",Michael Shindler expands upon Berman's argument that Weimar social clubs and similar associations in countries that did not develop democracy, were organized in such a way that they fostered a \"we\" instead of an \"I\" mentality among their members, by arguing that groups which possess cultures that stress solidarity over individuality, even ones that are \"horizontally\" structured and which were also common to pre-SovietEastern Europe, will not engender democracy if they are politically aligned with non-democratic ideologies. Using a network-based conception for characterizing the social capital of collectivities (such as organizations or business clusters),Lester, Maheshwari, and McLain (2013) note that negative social capital may be the cause for disadvantageous differences among minority firms versus majority firms. While studying norms amongAfrican-Americanfamily firms andEuro-Americanfamily firms, Lester et al. noted that negative social capital was created when the owner of the company was pressured to engage in social behavior not conducive to firm profits. Robert Putnam, in his later work, also suggests that social capital, and the associated growth ofpublic trustare inhibited by immigration and rising racialdiversityin communities.Putnam's study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a lack of homogeneity, some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (US) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high (Eastern Europe), it was found that citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be.  Lack of homogeneity led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital. Varshney (2001) studied the correlation between the presence of interethnic networks (bridging) versus intra-ethnic ones (bonding) onethnic violenceinIndia.He argues that interethnic networks are agents of peace because they build bridges and manage tensions, by noting that if communities are organized only along intra-ethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak or even nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely.\nThree main implications of intercommunal ties explain their worth: This is a useful distinction; nevertheless, its implication on social capital can only be accepted if one espouses thefunctionalistunderstanding of the latter concept. Indeed, it can be argued that interethnic, as well as intra-ethnic networks can serve various purposes, either increasing or diminishing social capital. In fact, Varshney himself notes that intra-ethnic policing (equivalent to the \"self-policing\"mechanism proposed by Fearon and Laitin, 1996)may lead to the same result as interethnic engagement. James Coleman(1988) has indicated that social capital eventually led to the creation ofhuman capitalfor the future generation.Human capital, a private resource, could be accessed through what the previous generation accumulated through social capital. John Field (2003) suggested that such a process could lead to the very inequality social capital attempts to resolve.While Coleman viewed social capital as a relatively neutral resource, he did not deny the class reproduction that could result from accessing such capital, given that individuals worked toward their own benefit. Even though Coleman never truly addressesPierre Bourdieuin his discussion, this coincides with Bourdieu's argument set forth inReproduction in Education, Society and Culture. Bourdieu and Coleman were fundamentally different at the theoretical level (as Bourdieu believed the actions of individuals were rarely ever conscious, but more so only a result of theirhabitusbeing enacted within a particular field, but this realization by both seems to undeniably connect their understanding of the more latent aspects of social capital. According to Bourdieu,habitusrefers to the social context within which a social actor is socialized. Thus, it is the social platform, itself, that equips one with the social reality they become accustomed to. Out of habitus comes field, the manner in which one integrates and displays their habitus. To this end, it is the social exchange and interaction between two or moresocial actors. To illustrate this, we assume that an individual wishes to better his place in society. He therefore accumulates social capital by involving himself in a social network, adhering to the norms of that group, allowing him to later access the resources (e.g. social relationships) gained over time. If, in the case of education, he uses these resources to better his educational outcomes, thereby enabling him to becomesocially mobile, he effectively has worked to reiterate and reproduce the stratification of society, as social capital has done little to alleviate the system as a whole. This may be one negative aspect of social capital, but seems to be an inevitable one in and of itself, as are all forms of capital. Compared to Bourdieu,Robert D. Putnamhas used the concept in a much more positive light: though he was at first careful to argue that social capital was a neutral term, stating \"whether or not [the] shared are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter,\"his work on American society tends to frame social capital as a producer of \"civic engagement\" and also a broad societal measure of communal health.He also transforms social capital from a resource possessed by individuals to an attribute of collectives, focusing on norms and trust as producers of social capital to the exclusion of networks. Mahyar Arefi (2003) identifies consensus-building as a direct positive indicator of social capital.Consensus implies \"shared interest\" and agreement among various actors and stakeholders to induce collective action.Collective actionis thus an indicator of increased social capital. InBowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community(2000), Harvard political scientistRobert D. Putnamwrites: Henry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America – though it will be – but because it will be good for us. Putnam speaks of two main components of the concept, the creation of which Putnam credits to Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal: Typical examples are that criminal gangs create bonding social capital, whilechoirsand bowling clubs (hence the title, as Putnam lamented their decline) create bridging social capital.The distinction is useful in highlighting how social capital may not always be beneficial for society as a whole (though it is always an asset for those individuals and groups involved). Horizontal networks of individual citizens and groups that enhance community productivity and cohesion are said to be positive social capital assets whereas self-serving exclusive gangs and hierarchical patronage systems that operate at cross purposes tosocietalinterests can be thought of as negative social capital burdens on society. Similar to Putnam,Daniel P. Aldrichdescribes three mechanisms of social capital: Aldrich also applies the ideas of social capital to the fundamental principles ofdisaster recovery, and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. In his bookBuilding Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery, he primarily examines Japanese recovery following the2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Social capital development on the internet via social networking websites such asFacebookorMyspacetends to be bridging capital according to one study, though \"virtual\" social capital is a new area of research. There are two other sub-sources of social capital: Consummatory capital a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. Two examples of consummatory social capital are value interjection and solidarity. Value interjection:refers to the behavior of individuals or groups adhering tosocietal normsby meeting expected obligations, such as following established rules, timely bill payments, and punctuality. Diligent adherence contributes personal advantages like financial stability and improved relationships, as well as broader societal gains, including enhanced market confidence and perceived reliability. Coleman goes on to say that when people live in this way and benefit from this type of social capital, individuals in the society are able to rest assured that their belongings and family will be safe.This understanding ofsolidaritymay be traced to 19th centurysocialistthinkers, whose main focus was the urban working class of theIndustrial Revolution. They analyzed the reasons these workers supported each other for the benefit of the group and held that this support was an adaptation to the immediate social environment, as opposed to a trait that had been taught to the workers in their youth.As another example, Coleman states that possessing this type of social capital individuals to stand up for what they believe in, and even die for it, in the face of adversity. While the notion ofsolidarity as social capitalis sometimes attributed toKarl Marx, in particular, the termsocial capitalhad a quite different meaning for Marx. All forms of \"capital\" were, for Marx, possessed only by capitalists and he emphasized the basis of labour in capitalist society, as a class constituted by individuals obliged to sell theirlabour power, because they lacked sufficient capital, in any sense of the word, to do otherwise. Marx saw \"social capital\" as a theoretical total amount of capital, purely in the sense of accumulated wealth or property, that existed in a particular society. He thereby contrasted it with specific and discrete \"individual capital.\" Instrumental capital is behavior that is taught through one's surroundings over time. Individuals donating their resources are not seeking direct repayment from the recipient, but motivated by membership in the same social structure. Donors might not see a direct repayment, but, most commonly, they will be held by the society in greater honor. Portes mentions the donation of a scholarship to a member of the same ethnic group as an example of this. The donor is not giving up resources to be directly repaid by the recipient, but, as stated above, the honor of the community. With this in mind, recipients might not know the benefactor personally, but prospers as a member of the same social group. Social capital is also linked with religious communities. Religion represents an important aspect of social capital (religious social capital).However, Putnam found that membership in secular organizations in the United States had a greater association withvolunteering,blood donations,charity, andphilanthropythan membership in religious organizations, that membership in secular organizations was associated with participation incommunity projectswhile membership in religious organizations was not, and that the difference was mostly attributable due to community and organizational involvement byreligious fundamentalistsbeing confined to activities within their congregations rather than the wider communities in which the congregations are located. There is no widely held consensus on how to measure social capital, which has become a debate in itself.While usually one can intuitively sense the level/amount of social capital present in a given relationship (regardless of type or scale),quantitative measuringhas proven somewhat complicated, resulting in different metrics for different functions. SociologistsCarl L. BankstonandMin Zhouhave argued that one of the reasons social capital is so difficult to measure is that it is neither an individual-level nor a group-level phenomenon, but one that emerges acrosslevels of analysisas individuals participate in groups. They argue that the metaphor of \"capital\" may be misleading because, unlikefinancial capital, which is a resource held by an individual, the benefits of forms ofsocial organizationare not held by actors, but are results of the participation of actors in advantageously organized groups. One type of quantitative social capital measure uses name generators to construct social networks and to measure the level of social capital.These networks are constructed by asking participants to name people that they interact with, such as \"Name all the people you've discussed important matters with in the past six months.\"Name generators are often useful to construct core discussion networks of close ties, rather than weaker ties. Many studies measure social capital by asking the question: \"do you trust the others?\" Other researches analyse the participation in voluntary associations or civic activities. To expand upon themethodologicalpotential of measuringonline and offlinesocial bonding, as it relates to social capital, Williams (2006), offers a matrix of social capital measures that distinguishes social bridging as a form of less emotionally-tethered relationships compared to bonding. Bonding and bridging sub-scales are proposed, which have been adopted by over 300 scholarly articles. Lin, Peng, Kim, Kim & LaRose (2012) offer a noteworthy application of the scale by measuring international residents originating from locations outside of the United States. The study found that social media platforms likeFacebookprovide an opportunity for increased social capital, but mostly for extroverts. However, less introverted social media users could engage social media and build social capital by connecting with Americans before arriving and then maintaining old relationships from home upon arriving to the states. The ultimate outcome of the study indicates that social capital is measurable and is a concept that may beoperationalizedto understand strategies for coping withcross-culturalimmersion through online engagement. The level ofcohesionof a group also affects its social capital and vice versa.However, there is no one quantitative way of determining the level of cohesiveness, but rather a collection of social network models that researchers have used over the decades to operationalize social capital. One of the dominant methods is Ronald Burt's constraint measure, which taps into the role of tie strength and group cohesion. Another network-based model is network transitivity. Knack and Keefer (1996) measuredeconometriccorrelations between confidence and civic cooperation norms, witheconomic growthin a large group of countries. They found that confidence and civic cooperation have a great impact in economic growth, and that in lesspolarizedsocieties in terms of inequality and ethnic differences, social capital is bigger. Narayan and Pritchet (1997) researched theassociativitydegree and economic performance in rural homes ofTanzania. They observed that even inhigh poverty indexes, families with higher levels of incomes had more participation in collective organizations. The social capital they accumulated because of this participation had individual benefits for them, and created collective benefits through different routes, for example: their agricultural practices were better than those of the families without participation (they had more information about agrochemicals, fertilizers and seeds); they had more information about the market; they were prepared to take more risks, because being part of a social network made them feel more protected; they had an influence on the improvement of public services, showing a bigger level of participation in schools; they cooperated more in the municipality level. In measuring political social capital, it is common to take the sum of society's membership of its groups. Groups with higher membership (such aspolitical parties) contribute more to the amount of capital than groups with lower membership, although many groups with low membership (such as communities) still add up to be significant.  While it may seem that this is limited by population, this need not be the case as people join multiple groups. In a study done byYankee City,a community of 17,000 people was found to have over 22,000 different groups. How a group relates to the rest of society also affects social capital, but in a different manner. Strong internal ties can in some cases weaken the group's perceived capital in the eyes of the general public, as in cases where the group is geared towards crime, distrust, intolerance, violence or hatred towards others. TheKu Klux Klanis an example of this kind of organizations. Foschi and Lauriola have presented a measure ofsociabilityas a proxy of social capital. The authors demonstrated that facets of sociability can mediate between general personality traits and measures of civic involvement andpolitical participation, as predictors of social capital, in aholisticmodel ofpolitical behavior. TheWorld Social Capital Monitoris an instrument for measuringsocial goodsand social capital created by theUnited Nations Sustainable Development Groupin partnership with civil society actors. The project identifies social values such astrust,solidarity,helpfulness,friendliness,hospitalityand the willingness to finance public goods with the help of anonymoussurveys. The surveys started in 2016. While influential, some have identified areas of concern or improvement within the work ofRobert D. Putnam. This includes: Robison and colleagues (2012) measured the relative importance of selfishness and four social capital motives using resource allocation data collected in hypothetical surveys and non-hypothetical experiments. Theselfishness motiveassumes that an agent's allocation of a scarce resource is independent of his relationships with others. This motive is sometimes referred to as theselfishness of preference assumptioninneoclassical economics. Social capital motivesassume that agents' allocation of a scarce resource may be influenced by their social capital or sympathetic relationships with others which may produce socio-emotional goods that satisfy socio-emotional needs for validation and belonging: Various authors give definitions ofcivil societythat refer to voluntary associations and organisations outside the market and state.This definition is very close to that of thethird sector, which consists of \"private organisations that are formed and sustained by groups of people acting voluntarily and without seeking personal profit to provide benefits for themselves or for others.\" According to such authors as Walzer (1992), Alessandrini (2002),Newtown, Stolle & Rochon, Foley & Edwards (1997),and Walters, it is through civil society, or more accurately, thethird sector, that individuals are able to establish and maintain relational networks. Thesevoluntary associationsalso connect people with each other, build trust and reciprocity through informal, loosely structured associations, and consolidate society through altruism without obligation. It is \"this range of activities, services and associations produced by... civil society\" that constitutes the sources of social capital. Not only has civil society been documented to produce sources of social capital, according to Lyons'Third Sector(2001),social capital does not appear in any guise under either the factors that enable or those that stimulate the growth of the third sector. Likewise, Onyx (2000) describes how social capital depends on an already functioning community.The idea that creating social capital (i.e., creating networks) will strengthen civil society underlies current Australian social policy aimed at bridging deepening social divisions. The goal is to reintegrate those marginalised from the rewards of the economic system into \"the community.\" However, according to Onyx (2000), while the explicit aim of this policy is inclusion, its effects are exclusionary. Foley and Edwards (1997) believe that \"political systems...are important determinants of both the character of civil society and of the uses to which whatever social capital exists might be put.\"Alessandrini agrees, saying that, \"in Australia in particular,neo-liberalismhas been recast aseconomic rationalismand identified by several theorists and commentators as a danger to society at large because of the use to which they are putting social capital to work.\" The resurgence of interest in social capital as a remedy for the cause of today's social problems draws directly on the assumption that these problems lie in the weakening of civil society. However this ignores the arguments of many theorists who believe that social capital leads to exclusion rather than to a stronger civil society.Ininternational development,Ben Fine(2001) andJohn Harriss(2001) have been heavily critical of the inappropriate adoption of social capital as a supposed panacea (promoting civil society organisations and NGOs, for example, as agents of development) for the inequalities generated by neoliberal economic development.This leads to controversy as to the role of state institutions in the promotion of social capital.\nAn abundance of social capital is seen as being almost a necessary condition for modernliberal democracy. A low level of social capital leads to an excessively rigid and unresponsive political system and high levels of corruption, in the political system and in the region as a whole. Formal public institutions require social capital in order to function properly, and while it is possible to have too much social capital (resulting in rapid changes and excessive regulation), it is decidedly worse to have too little. Post-Communist: Kathleen Dowley and Brian Silver published an article entitled \"Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States\", in which they find that inpost-communist states, higher levels of social capital did not equate to higher levels of democracy. However, higher levels of social capital led to higher support for democracy. Third-world: A number of intellectuals indeveloping countrieshave argued that the idea of social capital, particularly when connected to certain ideas about civil society, is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor andNGO-drivenimperialismand that it functions, primarily, to blame the poor for their condition. Chinese: The concept of social capital in a Chinesesocial contexthas been closely linked with the concept ofguanxi. American: One attempt to measure social capital, involving the quantity, quality and strength of an individual social capital, was spearheaded by Corporate Alliance in the English-speaking market segment of the US,and Xentrum through the Latin American Chamber of Commerce in Utah on the Spanish-speaking population of the same country.With the assistance of software applications and web-based relationship-oriented systems such asLinkedIn, these kinds of organizations are expected to provide its members with a way to keep track of thenumberof their relationships, meetings designed to boost thestrengthof each relationship using group dynamics, executive retreats and networking events as well as training in how to reach out to higher circles ofinfluentialpeople. There are many factors that drive volume towards theballot box, including education, employment, civil skills, and time. Careful evaluation of these fundamental factors often suggests that women do not vote at similar levels as men. However the gap between women and menvoter turnoutis diminishing and in some cases women are becoming more prevalent at the ballot box than their male counterparts. Recent research on social capital is now serving as an explanation for this change. Social capital offers a wealth of resources and networks that facilitate political engagement. Since social capital is readily available no matter the type of community, it is able to override more traditional queues for political engagement; e.g.: education, employment, civil skills, etc. There are unique ways in which women organize. These differences from men make social capital more personable and impressionable to women audiences thus creating a stronger presence in regards to political engagement. A few examples of these characteristics are: The often informal nature of female social capital allows women to politicizeapoliticalenvironments without conforming to masculine standards, thus keeping this activity at a low public profile. These differences are hard to recognize within the discourse of political engagement and may explain why social capital has not been considered as a tool for female political engagement until as of late. A growing body of research has found that the presence of social capital through social networks and communities has a protective quality on health. Social capital affects health risk behavior in the sense that individuals who are embedded in a network or community rich in support, social trust, information, and norms, have resources that help achieve health goals.For example, a person who is sick with cancer may receive the information, money, or moral support needed to endure treatment and recover. Social capital also encourages social trust and membership. These factors can discourage individuals from engaging in risky health behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking. Furthermore, neighbourhood social capital may also aid in buffering health inequities amongst children and adolescents.Social capital indicators such as neighbourhood cohesion,social support, and ties providing a bond between members of the same religion, have been found to be associated with better health despite financial or socioeconomic hardship.The function of social capital as a health buffer in circumstances of social disadvantage has also received attention in research on the health of minority ethnic populations. The relationships and networks that are maintained by an ethnic minority population in a geographical area where a high percentage of residents belong to the same ethnic group may lead to better health outcomes than would be expected based on other individual and neighbourhood characteristics. Such effects have been investigated in England,New Zealand,and the United States. Inversely, a lack of social capital can impair health. For example, results from a survey given to 13- to 18-year-old students in Sweden showed that low social capital and low social trust are associated with higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and depression.Additionally, negative social capital can detract from health. Although there are only a few studies that assess social capital in criminalized populations, there is information that suggests that social capital does have a negative effect in broken communities. Deviant behavior is encouraged by deviant peers via favorable definitions and learning opportunities provided by network-based norms.However, in these same communities, an adjustment of norms (i.e. deviant peers being replaced by positive role models) can pose a positive effect.\nResearchers have also investigated the hypothesis that the health benefits of social capital depend on the socioeconomic resources an individual or community has available to them. For example, social capital may boost health only for those with higher levels of education, or more so for those with a higher rather than a lower income.This research is based on Bourdieu's notion that social, economic, and cultural capital are dependent on each other. Similar to watching the news and keeping abreast of current events, the use of the Internet can relate to an individual's level of social capital. In one study, informational uses of the Internet correlated positively with an individual's production of social capital, and social-recreational uses were negatively correlated (higher levels of these uses correlated with lower levels of social capital).An example supporting the former argument is the contribution of Peter Maranci's blog (Charlie on the Commuter Line) to address the train problems in Massachusetts. He created it after an incident where a lady passed out during a train ride due to the congestion in the train and help was delayed because of the congestion in the train and the inefficiency of the train conductor. His blog exposed the poor conditions of train stations, overcrowding train rides and inefficiency of the train conductor which eventually influenced changes within the transit system. Another perspective holds that the rapid growth of social networking sites such asFacebookandMyspacesuggests that individuals are creating a virtual-network consisting of both bonding and bridging social capital. Unlike face to face interaction, people can instantly connect with others in a targeted fashion by placing specific parameters with Internet use. This means that individuals can selectively connect with others based on ascertained interests, and backgrounds. Facebook is currently the most popular social networking site and touts many advantages to its users including serving as asocial lubricantfor individuals who otherwise have difficulties forming and maintaining both strong and weak ties with others. This argument continues, although the preponderance of evidence shows a positive association between social capital and the Internet. Critics of virtual communities believe that the Internet replaces our strong bonds with online \"weak-ties\"or with socially empty interactions with the technology itself.Others fear that the Internet can create a world of \"narcissismof similarity,\" where sociability is reduced to interactions between those that are similar in terms of ideology, race, or gender.A few articles suggest that technologically based interactions has a negative relationship with social capital by displacing time spent engaging in geographical/ in-person social activities.However, the consensus of research shows that the more time people spend online the more in-person contact they have, thus positively enhancing social capital. Recent research, conducted in 2006, also shows that Internet users often have wider networks than those who access the Internet irregularly or not at all. When not considering family and work contacts, Internet users actually tend to have contact with a higher number of friends and relatives.This is supported by another study that shows that Internet users and non-Internet users do feel equally close to the same number of people; also the Internet users maintain relationships with 20% more people whom they \"feel somewhat close\" to. Other research shows that younger people use the Internet as a supplemental medium for communication, rather than letting the Internet communication replace face-to-face contact.This supports the view that Internet communication does not hinder development of social capital and does not make people feel lonelier than before. Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe (2007) suggest social capital exercised online is a result of relationships formed offline; whereby, bridging capital is enabled through a \"maintenance\" of relationships. Among respondents of this study, social capital built exclusively online creates weaker ties.A distinction of social bonding is offered by Ellison et al., 2007, suggesting bonds, or strong ties, are possible through social media, but less likely. Conversely, in the afterword to the second edition ofBowling Alone(2020), political scientistRobert D. Putnamfound that the expansion ofinternet access,social media,social networking services,online dating services,professional networking services, ande-commercewas probably accelerating the decline in social capital among the U.S. population that began in the 1960s, while mostly just reinforcing existing social connections rather than creating new ones (i.e. bonding social capital versus bridging social capital)—analogously to the effect that theexpansion of telephone ownership by U.S. householdshad (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1890 to a majority by 1946 and to 75 percent by 1957). In the first edition ofBowling Alone(2000), Putnam found that the social capital decline was caused primarily by theexpansion of television ownershipby U.S. households (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1948 to 75 percent by 1955), the gradual replacement of theGreatest GenerationandSilent Generationbirth yearcohortsby theBaby boomerandGeneration Xbirth year cohorts, and the effect of the television ownership expansion on Baby boomers and Generation X.Putnam anticipated that if internet use resembled television and telephone use that the impact of the internet on social capital would largely be the same as the television and the telephone, but Putnam rejectedtechnological determinismin suggesting that the impacts of the internet on social capital was not inevitable and would depend on how Americans collectively chose to use the internet.With respect to political and civic engagement specifically, Putnam referenced meta-analyses and other research in political science in the second edition ofBowling Alonethat concluded that the effects of social networking services and social media on political and civic participation was minimal or negative. When considered with the use of social media forpassive observationoronline-only and low-effort supportof political and social movements, Putnam concluded that the relationship betweeninternet activismand offlineactivismiscorrelational rather than causalin light of research about pre-internet political and social movements (such as thecivil rights movementandopposition to the Vietnam Warin the United States and the 1989Peaceful RevolutioninEast Germany) showing that personal connections with other activists are a stronger predictor of which individuals remain part of a movement rather than ideological commitment.Instead, Putnam argued that the weight of the research showed that social media has exacerbatedpolitical polarization in the United Statesdue to ideological and socioeconomichomophilyamongusersocial networks andsocial media algorithmsthat promoteecho chambers,virtue signalling, anddisinformation.However, Putnam also suggested that these effects of social media owed to thesurveillance capitalismbusiness models of the companies that operated the services rather than the technology itself, which created incentives for the companies to promoteconsumerismrather than building social capital andsocial trust. Coleman and Hoffer collectedquantitative dataof 28,000 students in total 1,015 public, Catholic and other private high schools in America from the 7 years' period from 1980 to 1987.It was found from thislongitudinal researchthat social capital in students' families and communities attributed to the much lower dropout rates inCatholic schoolscompared with the higher rates in public. Teachman et al. (1996) further develop the family structure indicator suggested by Coleman. They criticise Coleman, who used only the number of parents present in the family, neglected the unseen effect of more discrete dimensions such as stepparents' and different types of single-parent families. They take into account of a detailed counting of family structure, not only with two biological parents or stepparent families, but also with types of single-parent families with each other (mother-only, father-only, never-married, and other). They also contribute to the literature by measuring parent-child interaction by the indicators of how often parents and children discuss school-related activities. Morgan and Sorensen (1999) directly challenge Coleman for his lacking of an explicit mechanism to explain why Catholic schools students perform better than public school students on standardised tests of achievement.Researching students in Catholic schools and public schools again, they propose two comparable models of social capital effect on mathematic learning.  One is on Catholic schools as norm-enforcing schools whereas another is on public schools as horizon-expanding schools. It is found that while social capital can bring about positive effect of maintaining an encompassing functional community in norm-enforcing schools, it also brings about the negative consequence of excessive monitoring. Creativity and exceptional achievement would be repressed as a result. Whereas in horizon expanding school, social closure is found to be negative for student's mathematic achievement. These schools explore a different type of social capital, such as information about opportunities in the extended social networks of parents and other adults.  The consequence is that more learning is fostered than norm-enforcing Catholic school students. In sum, Morgan and Sorensen study implies that social capital is contextualised, one kind of social capital may be positive in this setting but is not necessarily still positive in another setting. In the setting of education through Kilpatrick, Johns, and Mulford (2010) state that \"social capital is a useful lens for analysinglifelong learningand its relationship to community development.\"Social capital is particularly important in terms of education. Also the importance of education with \"schools being designed to create 'functioning community' - forging tighter links between parents and the school\" linking that without this interaction, the social capital in this area is disadvantaged and demonstrates that social capital plays a major role in education. Putnam (2000) mentions in his bookBowling Alone, \"Child developmentis powerfully shaped by social capital\" and continues \"presence of social capital has been linked to various positive outcomes, particularly in education.\"According to his book, these positive outcomes are the result of parents' social capital in a community. In states where there is a high social capital, there is also a high education performance.The similarity of these states is that parents were more associated with their children's education. Teachers have reported that when the parents participate more in their children's education and school life, it lowers levels of misbehavior, such as bringing weapons to school, engaging in physical violence, unauthorized absence, and being generally apathetic about education.Borrowing Coleman's quotation from Putnam's book, Coleman once mentioned we cannot understate \"the importance of the embeddedness of young persons in the enclaves of adults most proximate to them, first and most prominent the family and second, a surrounding community of adults.\" Without social capital in the area of education, teachers and parents who play a responsibility in a students learning, the significant impacts on their child's academic learning can rely on these factors. With focus on parents contributing to their child's academic progress as well as being influenced by social capital in education. Without the contribution by the parent in their child's education, gives parents less opportunity and participation in the student's life. As Tedin and Weiher (2010)state, \"one of the most important factors in promoting student success is the active involvement of parents in a child's education.\" With parents also involved in activities and meetings the school conducts, the more involved parents are with other parents and the staff members. Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community. Sampson et al. (1999) stress thenormativeor goal-directed dimension of social capital,claiming that \"resources or networks alone (e.g. voluntary associations, friendship ties, organisational density) are neutral---they may or may not be effective mechanism for achieving intended effect.\" Marjoribanks and Kwok (1998) conducted a survey inHong Kongsecondary schools with 387 fourteen-year-old students with an aim to analyse female and male adolescents differential educational achievement by using social capital as the main analytic tool. In that research, social capital is approved of its different effects upon different genders. In his thesis \"New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance\", Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) argues that adaptation is a process of activation and accumulation of (cultural and social) capitals. The research findings show that supportive networks is the key determinant differentiating the divergent adaptation pathways. Supportive networks, as a form of social capital, is necessary for activating the cultural capital the newly arrived students possessed. The amount of accumulated capital is also relevant to further advancement in the ongoing adaptation process. Min ZhouandCarl L. Bankston(1998), in their study of aVietnamesecommunity inNew Orleans, found that preserving traditional ethnic values enableimmigrantsto integrate socially and to maintainsolidarityin an ethnic community.Ethnic solidarity is especially important in the context where immigrants just arrive in the host society.In her article \"Social Capital in Chinatown\", Zhou examines how the process of adaptation of youngChinese Americansis affected by tangible forms of social relations between the community, immigrant families, and the younger generations.Chinatown serves as the basis of social capital that facilitates the accommodation of immigrant children in the expected directions. Ethnic support provides impetus to academic success.  Furthermore, maintenance of literacy in native language also provides a form of social capital that contributes positively to academic achievement. Stanton-Salazar and Dornbuschfound that bilingual students were more likely to obtain the necessary forms of institutional support to advance their school performance and their life chances. In order to understand social capital as a subject ingeography, one must look at it in a sense of space, place, and territory. In its relationship, the tenetsof geography relate to the ideas of social capital in the family, community, and in the use of social networks. The biggest advocate for seeing social capital as a geographical subject was American economist and political scientistRobert Putnam. His main argument for classifying social capital as a geographical concept is that the relationships of people is shaped and molded by the areas in which they live. There are many areas in which social capital can be defined by the theories and practices. In 1984,Anthony Giddensdeveloped a theory in which he relates social structures and the actions that they produce. In his studies, he does not look at the individual participants of these structures, but how the structures and the social connections that stem from them are diffused over space.If this is the case, the continuous change in social structures could bring about a change in social capital, which can cause changes in community atmosphere. If an area is plagued by social organizations whose goals are to revolt against social norms, such as gangs, it can cause a negative social capital for the area causing those who disagreed with these organizations to relocate thus taking their positive social capital to a different space than the negative. Another area where social capital can be seen as an area of study in geography is through the analysis of participation in volunteerism and its support of different governments. One area to look into with this is through those who participate in social organizations. People that participate are of different races, ages, and economic status.With these in mind, variances of the space in which these different demographics may vary, causing a difference in involvement among areas. Secondly, there are different social programs for different areas based on economic situation.A governmental organization would not place a welfare center in a wealthier neighborhood where it would have very limited support to the community, as it is not needed. Thirdly, social capital can be affected by the participation of individuals of a certain area based on the type of institutions that are placed there.Mohan supports this with the argument of J. Fox in his paper \"Decentralization and Rural Development in Mexico\", which states \"structures of local governance in turn influence the capacity of grassroots communities to influence social investments.\"With this theory, if the involvement of a government in specific areas raises the involvement of individuals in social organizations and/or communities, this will in turn raise the social capital for that area. Since every area is different, the government takes that into consideration and will provide different areas with different institutions to fit their needs thus there will be different changes in social capital in different areas. In the context ofleisure studies, social capital is seen as the consequence of investment in and cultivation of social relationships allowing an individual access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable to him or her.The concept of social capital in relation toleisureis grounded in a perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness rather than the separateness of human activity and human goals. There is a significant connection between leisure and democratic social capital.Specific forms of leisure activity contribute to the development of the social capital central todemocracyand democratic citizenship. The more an individual participates in social activities, the moreautonomythe individual experiences, which will help her or his individual abilities and skills to develop. The greater the accumulation of social capital a person experiences, may transfer to other leisure activities as well as personal social roles, relationships and in other roles within asocial structure. Kislev (2019) shows that following vast changes to the status of marriage in modern society singles present higher social capital. They also derive greater happiness from equal levels of social capital compared with married people.In a later study, Kislev (2020) shows the relation between romantic relationships desire and singleness. He shows that a lower degree of relationship desire has a significant effect on the relative importance of friends. Furthermore, both higher levels of the relative importance of friends and social satisfaction are negatively correlated with relationship desire. Social capital has been associated with the reduction in access to informal credit in informal economies (especially in developing countries).Social capital in rural communities bring business-related knowledge and skills, entrepreneurial wellbeing, and economic benefits for individuals within communities, while for the community as a whole, strong social capital also brings extra shared economic benefits, and it can also foster socio-cultural change within the community. Similar results were revealed in across-sectional studyrun by Sarker inBangladesh.Some other authors also note the importance of social capital among female entrepreneurship. Epo (2013) presented the case that social capital and micro loans increase the likelihood of female entrepreneurship inCameroon.Epo did this by comparing the welfare outcomes of the entrepreneurs who both had access and no access. Other authors, however, disagree about the positive correlation between social capital andmicrofinance, Kanak and Iiguni argue that formation of social capital is largely dependent on strategies implemented by Microfinance Institutions.Kanak and Iiguni determined this while investigating social capital formation in a rural village in Bangladesh. For their study inIndianrural communities, Trivedi and colleagues make a distinction between internal social capital, i.e. within a rural community, and external social capital, i.e., between people from the community with people outside the community. They argue that both internal and external social capital need to be in place for a rural community to create entrepreneurial and economic benefits, which in turn can reduce poverty.",

Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known ascrest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass ordetention basinwhen the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.  Valves used in floodgate applications have a variety of design requirements and are usually located at the base of dams. Often, the most important requirement (besides regulating flow) is energy dissipation. Since water is very heavy, it exits the base of a dam with the enormous force of water pushing from above. Unless this energy is dissipated, the flow can erode nearby rock and soil and damage structures. Other design requirements include taking into accountpressure headoperation, the flow rate, whether the valve operates above or below water, and the regulation of precision and cost. The force on a rectangular flood gate can be calculated by the followingequation: where: If the rectangular flood gate is submerged below the surface the same equation can be used but only the height from the water surface to the middle of the gate must be used to calculate the force on the flood gate.",
